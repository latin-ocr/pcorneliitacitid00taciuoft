we again find a very pronounced family likeneSS‚·it‘being also a
peculiar characteristic of both authors that their prejudices against
the moral conduct of a man do not prevent them from doing full
justice to his intellectual abilities.⁸⁷

The same association of ideaS, finally, is noticeable in certain
miscellaneous items,88 particularly in utterances on the materi-
alistic character of forensic oratory as compared with that of the
past,⁸⁹ on the influence formerly enjoyed by oratorS,⁹⁰ the pursuit
of philosophy ⁹1 and the like. Everywhere ‘² apparent liniamenta
eiusdem viri et vultuS,’⁷ but what is still more significant perhaps,
the entire treatise contains not a single thought that can be said
to have been repudiated or contradicted in the historical works of
Tacitus.⁹2 '

We have reached the last stage in our journey and are now pre-
pared to consider the argument derived from the style of , the
Dialogus, which constituted, as has been repeatedly remarked, the ⁶
one great obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of the treatise
as a genuine work of Tacitus.

habebatur, promptus adversus insontes, XIII 3 oratio a Seneca composita
multum cultus praeferret ut fuit illi viro ingenium amoenum et temporis eius
auribus adcommodatum (see also XIII 11 XIV 52 and note c. 21 12) . Augusto
prompta et profluens . . . eloquentia fuit (see note 2 11.14). Tiberius artem quo-
que callebat, qua verba expenderet, tum validus sensibus aut consulto ambiguus,
etiam Gai Caesaris turbata mens vim dicendi non corrupit. nec in Claudio,
quotiens meditata dissereret, elegantiam requireres.

⁹2 Ann. IV 61, cited c. 6 25, is hardly a genuine exception, for although
Tacitus may in his later years, as has been pointed out ad loc., have esteemed
extemporary effusiohs less highly, it must be remembered that in the earlier
passage he speaks more particularly of the pleasure afforded by improvisations,
whereas the passage from the Annals deals rather with the ephemeral character
of impromptu speeches.
