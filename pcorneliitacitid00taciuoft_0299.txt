imperial family (Suet. Octav. 56 filiis praetextatis adhuc assure-

time, and during the Early Empire cf. Vita Virg. p. 57 : si quando

8 praesentem spectantemque: It is not necessary to regard this
phrase as a kind of hendiadyS, in the sense of ‘praesentem inter
spectatores! It is simply one of the numerous examples of that
fullness of expression so characteristic of the style of this treatise.
Cf. Plin2, Paneg. 56 ipsum praesentem audientemque consalutabant
imperatorem, where ‘audientem,' although equally superfluous, has
never been objected to. —Vergilium: The repetition of the proper
name here in place of a pronoun has the effect of emphasising the
significance of such an ovation being accorded to a private indivi-
dual. For similar repetitions in Τ. cf. H. V 21 Ann. I 13 II 28 III

10 Secundus Pomponius: A distinguished tragic poet and inti-
mate friend of the elder Pliny who became his biographer (Plin. N.
H. XIII 12, 26, 83 Pliny, Ep. III 5, 3). Η6 was a partisan of Seja-
nus and upon the downfall of this minister (31 A. D.) was thrown
into prison, where he is said to have remained for seven years till
released by Caligula, who raised him to the consulship, probably in
44 A. D. The emperor Claudius sent him as legatus to Germany,
where he defeated the Chatti, obtaining the honor of the triumphal
ornaments (50 A. n). Tacitus repeatedly speaks of him in- terms
of high praise. Cf. Ann. V 8 multa morum elegantia et ingenio
inlustri XII 28 decretusque Pomponio triumphalis honos, modica
pars famae apud posteros, in quis carminum gloria praecellit. His
