PROLEGOMENA. cxxvii

23 8.15 26 8 282 29 1. 18 32 14 33 20) D has erred in giving the
inflectional endings which were habitually abbreviated or, by con-
fusinq single letterS, easily misread or illegible in the original.
These errorS, because 01 their instantly recognisable origin, are not
apt to perplex the critic; they possess, in fact, a distinct value, in
that they permit him, without incurring the risk 01 conjectural
audacity, to restore the genuine reading on internal grounds alone,
even unanimity in the MSS. furnishing no positive indication 01
the reading 01 the archetypon. Michaelis' statement that D was
written ‘tamquam per somnium⁷ seems justified, when we observe
that it contains no fewer than 29 omissions (c. 5 2 7 12 8 29 9 4.12.
31 10 8 12 11 14 12 16 17 19 7. 14 21 24. 37 22 18 25 14. 15. 27 26 21
29 6 30 17 31 18. 25 33 17.18 35 6 36 20. 32), ten instances 01 ditto-
graphy (c. 6 6 12 18 15 8 24 8. 9 25 3 26 7.15 28 19 37 1ο), one of
haplography (28 10 1113113 [que] puerorum), and seven transpositions
(0. 6 8 10 18 19 14 28 26 30 11 40 8 41 14), 01 which the two first,
however, very probably represent the original reading. See notes
ad 100. 01 possible interpolations, Ι have 'noticed but five: c. 5 18
imperii [famam], but see note3 10 2 inquit omnes, 15 2 Maternum

. nostrum ,- 16 32 princeps ille; 25 18 Caesar et.

The genuine reading has been preserved in D vs. ω, 111 c. 31 15
ira 32 18 detrudunt (detrudant—w) 32 quosi (= quos si) forte
(quod si— ω). 111 c. 37 18 de expilatiS, the· preposition is probably
the false restitution of a lacuna, in place 01 ‘ aut‚’ which in Δ 13
found after ³ utrumne! See note ad loc.

4. The codex Fame-siamus or Neapolitanus (C) contains the
second part 01 the Annals (XI—XVI), the Histories, Dialoqus (183
10110 pages), Germania and the Suetonius fragment. It is a beau-
tifully written MS. Lacunae are indicated with care, either by
vacant spaces or by marginal notes 01 the scribe. It was known to
Lipsius, who valued it high1y‚21⁷ as did all subsequent scholars till

Michaelis dethroned C in favor 01 AB. The MS. was lost from
view for a long time, until rediscovered by Niebuhr in Naples.218

²¹⁷ ‘⁴ Quum depravatissimus vulgo circumferretur libellus . . . admirabile est
quantum a Farnesiano codice in eo sanando simus adiuti. Multi hiatus expleti,
verba et lineae integrae insertae, centeni aliquot loci emendati.'' Cp. Massmann
p. 7. That the MS. was written by a monk is evident‚ not only from the
picture of a monk at the beginning, but also from certain readings, such as
‘sanctitatis' for ‘civitatis ' (G. 10) and the omission of ‘ divus ⁹ in Dial. c. 17 8.

2¹⁸ Eckstein‚ Proley. p. 62 by a curicus error regarded this MS. as quite dis-
tinct from the Farnesianus.
