assigned to him by Hieronymus is unquestionably erroneouS. — quis
alius: On this favorite expression of Tacitus, see 0. 5 9. — Ephesum
· · · Mytilenas: Mytilenae, in the time of Augustus and Tiberius, was
the more famous school of the two. Cp. in general, Blass, Griech.
Beredsamlceit . . . bis auf Auqust. p. 68.

16 concentu: ‘Concordant acclamationss ‘Concentus’ and ‘cla-
mor,' of applause in a theatre, also in Plin. Paneg. 2 paulo ante
concentu . . . quibusque aliquando clamoribus.——scholasticorum:
‘hearers or pupils! In its usual sense =rhet0r. Cf. c. 26 31 42 7.
On the semasiological history of the word, cp. Valmaggi, Rivista di
filol. XX p. 504-9.—quatit: ‘shakes to its foundation? For a
similar figurative use, cf. esp. Val. Flacc. Ι 743 quatiunt truces
oracula Colchos Π 122 motis quatit oppida linguis V 273 omnem-
que quatit rumoribus Arcton. To what extremes such vociferous
approval sometimes went, may be seen from Libanius I p. 199.
Cf. also Mayor, Iuv. III 9 (vol. Ι p. 177 ext). On the popularity
of these later sophists and rhetoricians, cp. Friedlander ΠΙ 461 ff.

V 335-337 (Engl. Transl. I 394), Observe the chiastic collocation
in this closing paragraph (a-a ζ b —b :2 b—b —b : a—a).

‘Nos . . . recessimus’ would flatly contradict Aper’s unequivocal state-
ment regarding Messalla's attitude. Messalla repudiates the name of ora-
tor, however much others may insist that he is entitled to it (cf. c. 23 ext.
41 20 H. IV 42). Nor does he abandon this position in 0. 32 24 cur. . .
recesserimus, ‘why we of the present day, etc) or in c. 31 8 f. in iudiciis
fere de aequitate . . . disserimus, ‘in courts of law questions of justice,
etc. are discussed.' Why this latter utterame, in particular, should be
unsuitable to any one but a professional pleader, as Andresen and John

contend, is not intelligible to me. The statements evidently express only
a general idea.

16. 1 quaestionem movisti: Cf. Brut. 87, 297 rem commovisti
nova disputatione dignam. See c. 1 7 tam magnae quaestionis
pondus,

3 cura · · · meditatio: Perhaps to be taken as hendiadys ‘care-
ful reflection,' as indicated by the singular predicate. Cf. 0. 30 9
infinitus labor et cotidiana meditatio Ann. IV 61 scilicet impetu
magis quam cura vigebat; utque aliorum meditatio et labor in
posterum valescit and 0. 33 19.—A similar collocation is also

found in Greek e. g. Dem. 18, 308 μελέτη καὶ ἐπιμέλεια. 011 the
thought itself, cf. Cic. de rep. Ι 21, 34 ff.
