poor judges of oratorical excellence. -hercule occurs in 11 other
places in the D. (c. 5 26 8 26 14 21 19 19 21 8. 22 26 2. 6 30 19 34 25
39 23). Such exclamations are naturally employed more frequently
in speeches and in animated discourse than in historical narrative.
Gutmann⁷s severe criticism and the inference which he draws con-
cerning the Tacitean authorship of the D. are, therefore, wide of
the mark, particularly in view „of the following passages which
escaped his notice. H. I 84 Ann. I 26 III 54 IV 40 XIV 43 (in
speeches) I 3, 17 XII 43. For the non-syncopated form hercule
(hercle only c. 14) cp. Woelfflin, Plailol. XXV p. 104.—auderem:
According to Woelfflin (1. c. p. 97), all subjunctives relating to the
author Tacitus are in the singular (e. g. Ag. 1, Germ. 46 H. I 4,
Ann. II 35 III 25 IV 11 XIII 49 XIV 14 XVI 16), while indica-
tives are generally found in the plural, except in the Annals, where
the singular largely predominates. This last observation calls for
a slight modification, for in the Histories, at all events, sing. and
plur. indic. occur in equal proportion (19 121). Cp. Ε. Wolff, Die
Spraclw d. T. p. 3-6. Tacitus grew more reflective and subjective
in his later works, hence the greater frequency of the sing. indic.
‘ mea mihi' like ‘tuus tibi' ⁴ suus sibi’ is the invariable position (cp. R. V.
ΠΙ p. 144 note 387). The collocation of the poss. pronoun before or after
its noun does not carry any additional emphasis in T., at least. Schurz-

fieisch's inversion of the MS. reading ‘mihi mea' is, therefore, highly
probable, for only thus will ‘ mea ’ receive the proper stress.

11 ac non for the less usual ‘ et non' after ‘si ⁷ and ‘quasi' Cf.
H. Ι 40. Ann. VI 2. Common in Cicero, see Draeger H. S. ΙΙ2
p. 8.—ut‚ ² considering the age we live in.' On this restrictive ut
with an abl. see e. g. G. 45 30 Η. Ι 31. 81 III 33 Ann. IV 62 VI 35
and Dr. H. S. II 638. Occasionally ‘ut' is omitted, e. g. Ann. IV
20 ego Lepidum temporibus illis gravem . . virum fuisse comperior
(cf. G. Clemm, De breviloq. T. p. 111). On another similar use of
¹ut,' cp. Reid, Cic. Acad. II 31, 99.

13 admodum: T. always says ‘iuvenis admodum' (Ag. 7 Η. II
78 IV 5) but ‘admodum adulescens' (Ann. I 3 IV 44). The posi-
tion of this intensifying adverb is, however, not determined by any
fixed usage. E. g. G. 17 exceptis a. paucis, but Ann. V 2 paucis a.
receptis. II 8 castellum munitum a., but III 29 plebi a. laetae.
The same arbitrariness, unless we postulate euphonic reasons, pre-
vails in CicerO. Cp. Seyffert-Muller, Laelius p. 97. ——On the inter-
