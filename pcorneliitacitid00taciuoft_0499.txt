of the clepsydra. ——It may also be observed, that this passage
enables us to fix the much disputed date of Cicero's de legibus to
within a few months, viz. end of J an. and beginning of April 52
Β. c. Cp. Berl. Philol. Woclz. No. 31 s32 (1892>.-—Haec cannot refer
to the entire preceding clause, for the ‘numerus patronorum' was
not, so far as we know, regulated by the lex Pompeia. Cf. note l. 2.

7 imposuitque veluti frenos eloquentiae: The figure, common in
both Greek and Latin, was probably first used by Isocrates. Cf.
Suidas S.V. ’Ἔφορος z ὃ γοῦν Ἰσοκράτης τὸν μὲν Θεόπομπον ἔφη χαλινοῦ
δεῖσθαι, τὸν δὲ ’Έφορον κέντρου. Cic. de Orat. III 9, 36 quod dicebat
Isocrates se calcaribus in Ephoro, contra autem in Theopompo
frenis* uti solere Brut. 56, 204 ad Att. VI 1, 12 Quint. Π 8, 11
Plin. Ep. IX 26, 7 laxandos esse eloquentiae frenos Lucian, Har-
mod. 82 χαλινόν τινα ἐμβέβληκεν αὐτῷ ἡ φιλοσοφία In Tac. alSO Ann.
V 3 velut frenis exsoluti proruperunt (sc. Tiberius et Seianus).

8 omnia in soro, whereas trials are now conducted within the
walls of ‘auditoria et tabularia' (c. 39 5) which were originally
designed for quite different purposes. -— omnia legibus: Cf. Aper's
remark (c. 19 23) ubique apud eos iudices qui vi et potestate, non
iure et legibus cognoscunt, where see note.— omnia apud praetore&
for now the Senate‘and the Emperor have usurped many important
judicial functions, formerly belonging to the praetor. On the ana-
phora, see note c. 36 8.

9 negotia: ‘cases' Cf. note c. 3 20.—exerceri: exactly equiv-
alent to our technical use of ²try.' Cf. Ann. IV 19 cuncta quae-
stione maiestatis exercita. No other precisely parallel instances
are known to me.

10 causae centumvirales: The jurisdiction of the Centumviri
was always confined to civil suits, which the republican orators
could afford to neglect, but when the more important ¹ iudicia pub-
lica' had been relegated to the Senate and the Princeps, the cases
that came up before the centumviral court furnished the only
opportunity for a display of eloquence. Of. note c. 7 6.

12 obruebantur ‘thrown completely into the shade.' Cf. Tac. Ag.
17 Cerialis . . . alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset.

14 ut · · - liber apud centumviros dietus legatur: Leqatur has
hitherto always been taken in the sense of ‘is now read.' But,
apart from the fact that this involves the absurd assumption that
such speeches were necessarily of too inferior a character to merit
