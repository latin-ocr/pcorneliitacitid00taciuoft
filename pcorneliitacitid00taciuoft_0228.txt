86 NOTES.

Secundus had declined to act as umpire in terms which leave no doubt of
his sincerity. Aper cannot, therefore, be made to ignore this refusal as Rib-
beck Rh. Mus. XXVIII 502, Gilbert Fleck. Jahrb. 1886 p. 204 and Wolff ad
loc. contend, a view which they themselves are unable to maintain with-
out arbitrary changes in the text. The words ⁴ securus . . . possit' are
simply designed as John, Correspbi‘. Lp. 1-3, has convincingly shown, to

“ jeopardise the position of Maternus in the following debate, by depriving
,him of influentia} outside support. By the aforesaid refusal of Secundus,
Aper feels at liberty to impose conditione which he under other eircum-
stances had no right to suggest, he being as prejudiced a party on the one
side as Secundus on the other. There can, therefore, be no reasonable
doubt that the clause ‘ quatenus . . inveniri’ must contain a neqative-idea.

The emendations of John and Andresen are prompted by a desire to retain>

‘inveniri’ which, as it stands, is unintelligible. But their conjectures lack
the palaeographical simplicity of the reading non inveni (fiinv.) given in the
text. The infinitive inveniri was caused by the non patiar following. -Of
the numerous emendations proposed in place of ‘apud eos,' the reading·
of all our MSS., with the exception of D (ipsos), te is out of the question,
for Secundus does not assume the role of arbiter3 vos would include the
author himself who throughout the entire treatise keeps studiously in the
background, nor is it at all likely that Aper would have asked his young
pupil to sit in judgment upon Maternus, The same objection applies to
eos, ipsos or hos (Peterson). Eum is syntactically‚ se coaryuam palaeo-
graphically inadmissible. Nos (John), however, is an easy correction and
in perfect keeping with the context of the passage. Andresen objecta to
it because of the preceding ‘ eg0.' Nos, however, is not the plur. maiestatis
but includes Secundus. And even if it were, similar examples of inconcin—
nitas might easily be adduced from Tac. and other writers: e.vg. H. 1V5
incidimus . . repetam. Ag. 43 nobis nihil comperti, adfirmare ausim. Ann.
XIV 43 in nobis . . . existimabam. Cp. also Shakespeare, Jul. Caesar: If
thou be'st not immortal, look about yon. —Et finally has been defended
by John l. c., but as it is quite superfluous, it is perhaps better to delete it.
as a dittography of the preceding syllable, a notoriously common error.

natus ad: Sc. c. (3 4 10 23 Η. IV 64 viris ad arma natis. With

dative only Ag. 31 nata servituti. On c. 12 10 see crit. note. Cp.
Maue, De praep. ‘ad' ap. T. usu p. 51. —virilem et oratoriam: Cf.
Cic. de orat. I 54, 231 illam orationem disertam-sibi et oratoriam
videri, fortem et virilem non videri. Andresen interprets ‘virilem'
as explanatory of ³ oratoriam,' while Peter takes exactly the opposite
view, assuming ² et' as an epexegetic conjunction, a very common use
in Tac. (ef. Lex. Tac. p. 396¹> 397³). The Ciceronian model seems,
however, sufficient to show that both terms have each an indepen-
dent force. They were simply grouped together to distinguish the
sanctior et augustior eloquentia (= poetry) of Maternus from what
