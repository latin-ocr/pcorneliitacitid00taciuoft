rRoLEGOMENA. lxvii

This amusing paradox must, of course, be rejected, but does the

5 ³. alleged incongruity of c. 1-13 and 14-42, which gave rise to it,
J ῗ really exist ? Is the first part of our treatise, as scholars have
3] hitherto either tacitly or expressly assumed, nothing more than a
, ’ kind of dramatic setting or frame—work, designed primarily to bring
out some of the interlocutors into strong relief ? 1 am disinclined
'5⁴5 to rest satisfied with this explanation, for I regard it as an unjusti-
fiable and unmethodical proceeding to stamp one third of an entire
xj} work as virtually irrelevant and external to the principal theme,
which in the remaining portions exhibits an undeniable unity and
consistency of plan. We must therefore look for some closer inter-
ι dependence between these parts, and perhaps the following con-
Ϊῑ’ siderations may go to prove that such a link does indeed exist.

 

It -has often been observed that Latin literature of the first
century bears an unmistakable poetical coloring, and that poetical
effusions greatly preponderate over prose productioris. ‘ Scribimus
indocti doctique poemata passim⁷ might well serve as the motto of
this period. Even prose, in order to please, had to clothe itself in

poetical raiment, and so Aper, the passionate advocate of the elo-
, quence of his time, continually insistsxthat a speech must, above
‘ff‘ all, possess rhythm and poetical imagery. Cf. e. g. c. 20 18 exigitur

iam ab oratore etiam poeticus decor 22 13 sensus apte cadunt et

quodam lumine terminantur 20 26 marmore nitent et auro radi-
antur. Eloquence, in the beautiful peroration of Messalla (c. 32),

’ξ 01166 the queen of all the arts, who held sovereign sway over the
’ souls of men, is now banished from her proper realm3 she is

52· stripped of her retinue, without honor, without freedom. But, so
J>- we may add, keeping up the personification, her life was not
’ἶ extinguished, but she passed as a slave into the hands of poetry.
·. Hence it is that the poetry of the age is saturated throughout with

oratorical elements3 it had become declamatory, as prose had
become poetical‚ making free use of the poet⁷s vocabulary and con-

stent sich betreffs derselben mit der angegebenen Alternative einstweilen (Ξ) auf
den Standtpunkt seiner Zeitgenossen‚ er verschmaht (P) es bereits J'etzt anzu-
deuten‚ dass er sie auf eine der iiblichen Auffassung nicht entsprechenden 'vVeise
zu losen und mit ihr zugleich eine tiefere‚ ihm mehr am Herzen liegende (9) und
zugleich im Anfang der Schrift zu stellende Frage, die Frage nach dem Werth
der Beredsamkeit zu entscheiden gedenke. Und der Spannung der Leser hat
er damit einen guten Dienst gethan (?1).'’ How gratuitous and absurd this

’ allis!
