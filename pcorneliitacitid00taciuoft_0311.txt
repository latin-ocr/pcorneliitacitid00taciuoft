well; what it does lack is the elevated and fervid tone⁴ of the poet, and
this distinction is very appropriately expressed by ‘ardentior.’ The pas·

Aeschines, while the former pertains to bold translations of Greek words.

poetarum quam oratorum similior oratio: poetarum quam ora-
> torum orationum . . . oratio. An example of the so—called ³ compa-
ratio compendiaria,' by which the property belonging to the person
or thing is directly compared with the person or with the thing itself.
This brachylogy is often employed to avoid the awkward repetition
of the same word or the unidiomatic substitution of a demonstrative
pronoun. In Tacitus the construction is rare, e. g. G. 46 quae
omnia diversa Sarmatis (Ξ moribus Sarmatarum) sunt. Ag. 24
solum caelumque et ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a
Britannia differt. Cp. Dr. Stil p. 105. Quint. X 1, 31 est (sc.

Mayor to Iuv. III 7 4. sermo Ι promptus et Isaeo torrentior (= Isaei

III p. 624 f. The ‘complosio syllabarum' noticeable in similior
oratio, does not find favor in the eyes of Quintilian (IX 4, 41):
³ videndum etiam ne syllaba verbi prioris ultima et prima sequentis
sit eadem. But 111 311 save a few of the 32 instances in Tacitus
which Weinkauff p. 76 has collected, the conjunction of syllables
would have remained unnoticed by Roman ears, because of the
difference in quantity e. g. 0. 41 12 minor oratorum 0. 13 16 servi
videntur 36 1 flamma materia H. Π 1 decor oris. In Virgil and
Ovid (see the examples in R. V. III 866 note 819, where also other
literature on this subject is given) both syllables, it is true, have
the same quantity, but Quintilian⁷s criticism would not, even in
these cases, have been as fully justified as in Cicero's ‘invisae
visae ' or “ fortunatam natam ’ quoted by him (l. c.) in illustration.

Et—atque, J‘oining two clauses, is an intolerable solecism. Cp. Hand
Tur-3. I 529 5 Madvig de fin. p. 3883, and Dr. H. S. II 81, who is prac-
tically of the same opinion. Halm has, therefore, justly deleted ⁶ et ’ as a
dittography of the preceding syllable. Nevertheless, Andresen's suggestion
(Emend. 141 f.) to insert ⁶ et oratio ' has met with great favor (Peter, John,
Wolff). It is based upon the assumption that ‘sermo’ must here have the
