 

PROLEGOMEN A. XXV

s Α sum total of a preceding enumeration, but is the objectiva point

of Aper's entire arqumentation. The number 120 is a fioecd quantity,
for according to a prevalent belief among the Romans just so many
years constituted the ultimate limit of the natural life of man, and
inasmuch as the interval between the death of Cicero and the
speaker's time does not exceed this limit, a fact which is established
by the computation of the reigns of the emperors, the injustice
of the appellation ‘antiqui,⁷ when applied to the orators of the
Ciceronian age, is in Aper’s opinion clearly demonst1·ated.²⁶

But if our text is perfectly sound and unobjectionable, the data
furnished by it are equally unimpeachable. We, therefore, conclude
that the dramatic date of the Dialogue is the year 75 or 74, accord-
ing as we reckon the still incompleted sixth year (iam) of Vespasian
from Jan. 1. ’ΤΟ 01· J uly 1. 69 A. D. Tacitus was at that time 19 s20
years old, presumably a little younger, his friend Pliny only a
boy of 13s14‚ and Quintilian nearly 40 and for about three years
the incumbent of a rhetorical chair in Rome.

This date is in a measure confirmed by a terminus ante quem,
furnished by c. 37 ὃ ff. Mucianus is there represented as still
actively engaged upon a work entitled ‘Acta' ²⁷ But in the follow-
ing passage of ‘Pliny's Nat. Hist. (XXXII 6, 62) the same Muci-
anus is unmistakably alluded to as one no longer living : Haec sint
dicta de corpore, sed dicemus et de nationibus, ne fraudentur gloria
sed dicemus aliena lingua quaeque peritissima huius censurae in
nostro aevo fuit. Sunt ergo Muciani verba quae subiciam. Now
Pliny dedicated his Natural Histoi-y to Titus in 77 Α. 1). Mucianus
must, therefore, have died a short time previously, the reference
to him being found in the 32d book. Andresen, whom Peter-
lechner, as usual, simply echoes, is not disposed to attach any
validity to the inference drawn from the above passage, because
Pliny may (1) just as well have intended to convey the meaning
‘der, wo es sich um die Behandlung solcher Dinge handelte, in
unserem Zeitalter am eiusichtsvollsten geredet hat.' This interpre-

25 For a detailed discussion of this interpretation, the reader is referred to
my note ad loc.1(pp. 185-187). Dr. Lodge‚ of Bryn Mawr, ingeniously suggests
that my view would derive additional weight, if we read ‘colligantur ' for
‘ colliguntur. '

²⁷ I rejoice to find that my contention that these ⁶ Acta ’ had nothing what-
ever to do with the well known official publications‚ is shared by Kubitschek in
the new edition of Pauly's Realencycl. 1 col. 295, 16 ff. s. v. Acta.
