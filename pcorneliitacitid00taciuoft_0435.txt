province of Achaia which he could have visited for any educational
purpose. —omnem omnium artium varietatem: Of the nine ‘libe-
rales artes ⁹ enumerated by Varro, five are here expressly mentioned,
two clearly implied, namely rhetoric, for according to the Brutus,
Cicero⁷s teachers in Asia were rhetor-iciam (hi tum in Asia rhetorum
principes numerabantur) and astroloqy (astronomy) which is in.-
cluded in ² rerum motus causasque.⁷ The remaining ² arteS,⁷ medicine
and architectum are designedly omitted for obvious reasons. On
the number and variety of the liberal arts froin Varro to the time
of Charlemagne, see Th. Davidson, Aristode and Ancient Educa-
tional Ideals, London 1892 p. 239-247 (Appendix). -With the
expression itself, cf. Cic. de orat. III 19, 7 2 veteres illi . . . omnem

which the author, by the use of emphatic exclamation (hercule),

epanalepsis, climax, evenly balanced clauses, and an accumulation
of synonymous or redundant expressions succeeds in reflecting
stylistically the warmth of feeling and ,intensity of conviction
which animates the speaker in this closing part of his argument,
and this in spite of the fact that the entire paragraph betrays an
unmistakable indebtedness to Ciceronian passages both in thought
and phraseology. —The necessity of acquiring as universal a know-
ledge as possible is constantly inculcated by Cicero. Cf. e. g. de
