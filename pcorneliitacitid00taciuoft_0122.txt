V. — THE MANUSGRIPTS.2⁰⁴

The extant MSS. of the DialogUS, all of the 15th century, are
derived from the copy 2⁰⁵ of a MS. of unknown date, discovered in
some German monastery and brought to Italy about the year
1457s8.20⁶ *

That this apographon belonged to the Vatican library, as is
generally assumed, is, in my judgment, more than doubtful, for
the fact that Calixtus III and Pius II were no patrons of learning,

cannot· possibly account, as Michaelis strangely imagineS, for its -

early disappearance from the library, not to mention that the great
humanist Pope, Nicolaus V, was no longer living († 1455) when the
unknown works of Tacitus, so long expected by him and Poggio,
finally reached Italy. The precious MS., in all probability, passed
into private hands or, like the cod. Mediceus discovered by Boc-
caccio at Monte CassinO, into some cloister's library, where it was

son pp. lxii—lxxxix.

20⁵ That it was not the original MS., has been shown by Reifferscheid pp.
410 f. The provenance oi this MS. is involved in obscurity. Reifferscheid
argued in favor of the monastery of Fama, which is known to have possessed
the works of Tacitus, for Rudolfas of Fulda († 865) and his successor, Meyinhard‚
incorporated into their joint work, the Translatio S. Alexandri, whole chapters
of the Germania (c. 4. 9. 10. 11. See Massmann p. 160). 111 his Addenda p.
xiv, Reifferscheid preferred Gorbey, from which cloister he believed Rudolfus
borrowed his copy of Tacitus. Others, on more plausible grounds, favor the
monastery of Hersfeld‚ for in Poggio's correspondence (cf. Michaelis pp. xix-
xxii) touching the discovery of hitherto unknown works of Tacitus, a ‘ monachus
Hersfeldensis ' plays a very prominent part.

20⁶ I have no hesitation in rejecting, with Voigt, Wiederbelebunq des class.
Alterthums 12 pp. 257 f. note 4, the universally accepted tradition which attrib-
utes the discovery of the Dialogus, the Germania and the Suetonius fragment to
Henoch of Ascolz‘. It rests solely upon a statement of Iovianus Fontanus
(quoted below) which, as Voigt has convincingly shown, is open to very grave
objections. Poggio‚ moreover, never mentions Henoch in connection with the
new Tacitean treatises, and the well-informed Vespasiano, in his biographical
sketch of Henoch, expressly says that this monk found nothing of particular
importance‚ excepting the cook-book of Pseudo Apicius and Porphyrio's com-
mentary to 'Horace (see Voigt II p. 203 note 1). 011 the probable origin of
Pontanus' error, see note 213.
