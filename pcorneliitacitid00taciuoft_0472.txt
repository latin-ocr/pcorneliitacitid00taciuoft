c. 20 8 adfluens, But this interpretation places the emphasis upon
a very secondary element in the thought. Translate : For there is

nothing of respect in a school-room, into which all (teacher and ’

With the exception of sed (set) which was corrupted out of est by
metathesis (cf. crit. note c. 12 14), the much disputed passage appears to
me perfectly sound. John, followed by Wolff, writes ‘ut in quem . . .
intrat‚’ but has to have recourse to a ‘Erneuerung eines altlateinischen

controversiae: suasoriae belong to the genus deliberativum (συμ-
βουλευτικόν), controversiae to the genus iudiciale (δικανικόν). The
epideictic branch is here omitted, because rhetoricians regarded its
