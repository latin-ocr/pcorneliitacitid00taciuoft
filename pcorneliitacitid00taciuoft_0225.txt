6 Saleius Bassus: Highly extolled by Secundus and again by
Aper c. 9, 8, but not without a tinge of irony. Quintilian damns
him with faint praise : X 1, 90 (among the epic poets) vehemens et
poeticum ingenium Salei Bassi fuit nec ipsum senectute maturuit.
The ‘ fuit⁷ shows that the old poet was dead, when these words were
written. He cannot, therefore, as is generally done, be identified
with the Saleius designated by Iuv. VII 80 as tenuiS, for this satire
was written nearly fifty years after Saleius Bassus had been pre-
sented with a gift of 500,000 sestertia (32Q000) by Vespasian, as
we learn from c. 9 25, and about thirty years after Quintilian's
remark. Nor is there any reason for supposing that he is the same
whose tragedies (Colchis, Thyestes, Niobe, Andromache) Martial,

aptissima chartis Deucalion (i. e. water) vel, si non placet hic,
Phaethon (fire). Cp. Teuffel ξ 318, 2.—absolutissimum: absolutus
strictly speaking admits of no superlative, but similar exx. are
numerous. E. g. ad Herenn. II 18, 28 Plin. N. H. XXXV 10, 36,
74, Plin. Ep. I 20, 10. Cp. Neue, Formenl. II3 220. So perfec-
tissimus, on which see Neue 1. c. 235 and Sandys⁷ note to Orat. 1, 3.
-In the sense of ‘ perfect' and applied to persons, ³ absolutus' is
extremely rare e. g. Cic. Tim. 4 animanti absoluto de div. II 72,
150 qui (sc. philosophi) prope iam absoluti ct perfecti. Sen. Ep.

XXIII 48 eum ipsum tributum conferentium numerum. — cum-tum:
In Tac. only here, c. 14 19 and Ann. XV 48 cum odio Neronis tum
favore in C. Pisonem. No satisfactory rule can be given for the
use of cum-tum and tum-tum (common in Cicero and revived by
Quintilian), owing to the' constant confusion between these forms
in our MSS„ but tum when thus correlated with cum generally
introduces a stronger (as here) or more important assertion. Cp.
