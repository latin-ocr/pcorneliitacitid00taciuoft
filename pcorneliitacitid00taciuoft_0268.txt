126 NOTES.

866 Heller, Philol. LI p. 347. Hence ² si ita res familiaris exigat '
is in its proper place, and Wolff’s suggestion to transpose 1116
phrase after ‘quidemj or Andresen's to supply it in thought, is not
only superfluous but not in keeping with the sense of the passage.
——genium propitiare: Here used ’111-113116 561156 of ³ genio indulgere,
to enjoy the good things of life! Cf. Pers. V 151 indulge genio t
carpamus dulcia. These phrases embody virtually one and the
same idea—-a fulness of expression due to the speaker's desire
to inculcate the importance of pursuing a profession which will
enable a man to acquire, as Aper himself 1166 (10116, affluence, high
political positions and an enviable reputation, merely by his own
intellectual efforts and in the face of discouraging obstacles. The
commentators less correctly take ² genium propitiare' in its literal
sense, in reference to the ancient superstition of tutelary spirits
(on which cp. Pauly, R. E. III 693 L. Preller, R5m. Myth. p. 566
81111111, Dict. Bioyr. II 241 f. and Kiessling, Hor. Ep. II 1, 143),
111115 assuming that the poet Bassus had hitherto been invoking the
good will of the ² genius' of another, which he is now called upon
to abandon in favor of his own tutelary deity. With the thought
vitself, cf. 8611. Ep. 15, 10 quam iucundum sit nihil poscere, quam
magnificum sit plenum esse nec -ex fortuna pendere, and Shake-

 

speare, Henry VIII ‘ How wretched is that poor man that hangs on ,

princes’ favors.'

29 adice quod, like ‘adde quod' formed 011 1116 analogy of ‘accedit
quod' (cp. R. V. III p. 496 Schmalz, Lat. Sym. p. 499), 15 first found
'in Liv. XXIII 5, 9 6610116 66 11660 quod. Neither adice nor adde
quod occurs elsewhere in Tacitus. Cp. also 8611. Contr. IX praef.

3, once in Plin. Paneg. 53, 3. and Quint. II 17, 40 adiciunt his qui
contra sentiunt quod. It is, however, especially characteristic of

the younger Seneca, but usually in the form ³ adice nunc quod,' 6. g.

30 elaborare et efficere: Em in composition, especially in such
words as elaborare and efficere seems to add an intellectual clement
to the original meaning. Cp. R. V. II 19 f. note 322, a view
clearly confirmed by a passage in Plin. Ep. V 20, 5 11111115 Candi-
dus . . . solet dicere aliud esse eloquentiam, aliud loquentiam. The
same synonyms are joined by Cic. ad fam. IX 16, 2. - conversatio
is a post-Aug. word, first found 111 Vell. II 102, thereafter frequent,
