60 NOTES.

pretation of the phrase ‘iuvenis admodum’ by Andresen and others,
see Proleg. pp. xxvii—xxx.

14 memoria et recordatione ‘vivid recollection.' This collocaff
tion is common (e. g. Cic. de orat. I 53, 228 Brut. 2, 9 Tusc: V 31,
88> and the tautology only apparent, for memoria is the generic
term denoting merely the power by which we are enabled to repro-
duce impressions. Quint. XI 2, 43 recordatio firmissima memoriae
pars, hence Cic. de orat. Ι 2, 4 can say memoriae recordatio. Cp.
Seyff. Mun. Laelius p. 555 and the interesting passage in Plut. Cat.
Min. 1. So in Greek μνήμη and ἀνάμνησις.

Tacitean usage calls for ⁴ e—excepi' in place of the MS. reading ‘ aeaccepiss
as has been shown at length in Am. Jour. Phil. XII 327. The same scribal
error is found e. g. in ch. 2 10 and in Quint. X l, 86.

16 singuli eto. : A much disputed and generally misinterpreted
passage. It will be admitted that ¹ formam sui quisque et animi et
ingenii redderent⁷ is intended by the author to apply to all the
interlocutors, but this necessitates the further inference that Aper
is included among the singuli. If so, we cannot properly supply
corruptae eloquentiae after causas, for Aper vehemently denies
the very proposition. Andresen⁷s explanation that, as far as Aper
is concerned, ‘der Begriff des Verfalls der Beredsamkeit zu dem der
Veranderung erweitert wird' involves a kind of zeugma which
cannot be accepted without parallel instanceS. This difficulty is
avoided by supplying some such expression as ‘immutatae eloquen-
tiae.' On this point all the speakers are agreed. ‘Diversas ' has
the meaning of ³ various,' not ‘ opposite ' (mit R'ucksicht auf Apers
Standpunkt, Andresen), for Aper's attitude is not made known till
the end of the chapter. The reader so far naturally supposes that
the various speakers endeavored, each in his own way, to give the
reasons why the present age produced no real orator. This per-
feotly legitimate inference the author forthwith corrects by adding
that such unanimity did not exist among those who took part in
the debate ‘for there was also one present, who, as Ι would have
you know, took quite the opposite side ' etc. In all the interpreta-
tions hitherto proposed this peculiar force of enim (cf. c. 5 43
16 14) and so similarly nam (c. 2 13, where see note) is lost sight
of. Cp. also Dr. H. S. Π 169.

Roth's emendation sed easdem probabiles has met with great favor and
unquestionably satisfies the sense. But if so intelligible a reading had
