382 NOTES.

7 inquit: On the unusual position, cf. note c. 3 15. Regarding
the omission of any mention of SecunduS, see Proleg. p. lxxxiii.

8 cum adrisissent‚ discessimus: The commentators have ignored
and most translators missed the nicety and significance of the
change of persons. The author was throughout a passive listener,
his youth preventing him from taking any active part in the dis-
cussion. This attitude is with admirable tact maintained to the
end, as shown by the use of ‘adrisissent' for ‘adrisissemus.'—
Dis-cessimus, however, is a dramatic device intended to mark the
formal close of the debate, as ‘intravimus' (c. 3 1) had indicated
its formal beginning. —For similar closing remarks, cp. Plat. Prot.
καὶ περὶ τούτων δὲ εἰσαῦθις, ὅταν βούλῃ, διέξιμεν· νῦν δ’ ὥρα ἤδη
καὶ ἐπ’ ἄλλο ’.τ-ι τρέπεσθαι . . . ταῦτ’ εἰπόντες καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἀπῇ μεν.
Cic. de orat. I ext. et, cum exsurgeret, simul adridenS‚ ‘neque'
enim' inquit etc. de nat. deor. III ext. sed quoniam advesperascit,

dabis nobis diem aliquem ut contra ista dicamus . . . haec cum
essent dicta . . . discessimus·
