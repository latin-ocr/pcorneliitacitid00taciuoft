66 NOTEs

cannot be right. We require either ‘non in iudiciis modo' or ‘non modo
in iudiciis.’ The position of ί utrosque’ cannot be accurately determinffl,
but the strong tendency of Latin writers to bring pronouns into juxtaposi-
tion‚ favors the reading given in the text or ⁶ quos utrosque ego.’ The word

was probably accidentally omitted by the scribe and then replaced above the -

line, whence it was subsequently transferred to the text in the wrong place.
Ritter, followed by Halm and Novak, solve the difficulty by deleting the

utrosque, but this is wholly unjustifiable, no motive for interpolating this
word being conceivable.

7 in publico: ‘in public places) Usually opposed to ‘ domi,’ also
to ‘in privato,⁷ e. g. S. C. de Bacch. neve in poplicod neve in prei-
vatod. Heraeus' (H. I 19) distinction between ‘in public places'
and ¹ in the open street ² is strained and unnecessary. For similar
adverbia] expressions of ‘in' with abl., of which Tacitus seems
especially fond, cp. A. Gerber, Dc usu praep. p. 11 f.—adsectabar:
² attended, waited upon.⁷ So sectari c. 20 14 and 34 4 hunc sectari,
hunc prosequi, and not rare in classic writers. Peter taking the
word too strictly in the sense of ‘to follow,' is in consequence
compelled to assume a zeugma with domi, which, though slight in
itself, is obviated by the interpretation just given. For similar
expressions, such as se conferre, applicare, dicare, cp. Seyffi-Miill.
Lael. p. 9. It will be observed that T. here professes to have still
followed the time-honored custom, the total extinction of which he,
in a later chapter (34), deplores. Cf. also Quint. XII 11, 5: fre-
quentabunt vero eius (sc. Domiti Afri) domum optimi invenes more
veterum. ἢ

8 cupiditas: A good example, first pointed out by Woelfflin, to
illustrate the genetic development in the style of Tacitus. ‘ Cupidi-
tas’ occurs in but three other places in the smaller works (Ag. 15
G. 19. 35), the shorter ‘cupido' only once (Ag. 5). In the Histories
we find ‘ cupiditas ⁷ 5 times (H. I 83 is doubtful) ‘ cupido' 31 times.
In the Annals finally cupido has completely routed its competitor,
occurring ⁴47 times. We find the same partiality for the shorter
form in Sallust (232 3). In Cicero, however, cupido is used only in
personification, and Quint. has it only twice: VI pr. 13, X 7, 17.
—ardore iuvenili: The same phrase again occurs in Ag. 37. Quint.
VII 2, 24 says iuvenili cupiditate, Cic. de fin. I 13, 43 cupiditatum
ardore, but Tacitus regards both words as synonyms. —fabulast
(1) ‘ordinary conversation, small talk,' so here. (2) ‘gossip'—c.
3 ext. (3) ²ta1es, Marchen’—c. 29 4. (4) ‘legends, Sage'—c.
3 21 Ann. XII 58. (5) ‘drama'—Ann. XIII 21.
