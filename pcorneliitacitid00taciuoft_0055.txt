oratory and history, with which we are here more immediately
³ concerned‚ demand different rhetorical. treatment, is particularly
‘' emphasised in a well-known passage of the younger Pliny.¹⁰⁴'

These two causes, then, the psycholoqieal and the rhetorical, taken
in connection with the long interval of years that had elapsed
’ between the publication of the Dialogus and the larger historical
⁷, writingS, would in themselves be sufficient to account for the
J stylistic change which confronts us, ’

J An examination, however, of the Agricola and the Germania,
which are chronologically intermediate between the Dialogus and

·.. the Annals, shows that still a third factor had its share in effecting

,J the change under notice. For we observe that the Agricola and
J the Germania have still many stylistic features in common with

the Dialogue which one would look for in vain in the Subsequent

.„ writings. Again, not a few characteristic usages, still rare in the
‘f Dialogue‚ occur with constantly increasing frequency in the later
.. works, while others common in the Dialogus show a corresponding
³ decrease, often disappearing entirely in the AnnaIS. In other
'. wordS, the style of Tacitus, as it is revealed to us in its maturest
5: and latest form, is to a considerable extent the result of a qenetie

, development, passing gradually through various phases of growth or

J decay, which we are often still able to trace. This fact, thanks to
Woelfflin, is now all but universally admitted,¹⁰⁸ and it will, there-

5 · fore, suffice for our present purpose to illustrate the point by
³ f adducing a few salient examples.¹⁰⁹

1⁰⁷ Plin. Ep. V 8, 9 f. habet quidem oratio et historia multa communia sed

.. plura diversa in his ipsis quae communia videntur, narrat illa, narrat haec sed
ζ’ . aliter: huic pleraque humilia et sordida et ex medio petita, illi omnia recondita,
3· ² splendida, excelsa conveniunt: hanc saepius ossa musculi nervi, illam tori qui-
'„ dam et quasi iubae decent: haec vel maxime vi amaritudine instantia, illa
ῑ’ tractu et suavitate atque etiam dulcedine placet: postremo alia verba, alius
45'? sonus, alia constructio.

10⁸ Wolff, Die Sprache des Tacitus and Schanz 1. c. are, so far as Ι know, the

only scholars who seem disposed to question the truth of Woelfflin's observation,
,ζ’ ’ but even Wolff does so only in part, while Schanz merely denies it without the
slightest attempt at refutation.

ι ¹⁰⁹ Cp. also J ansen pp. 73-78 Weinkauff pp. cxxxvii-cxlii. This index com-
-ζ, parativus abounds in erroneous references and irrelevant quotations, and may

so far as stylistic questions are concerned‚ be practically dispensed with, the
‚¹¹ monumental Lex. Tac. being nearly completed.
