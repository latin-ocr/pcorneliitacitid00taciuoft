304 NOTES.

philosopher (sapiens) or lose himself in the dialectical subtleties
practiced by the Stoics and their followers3 what I do insist on, is
that, while having a complete mastery over some branches of study
(haurire), he should be also sufficiently conversam: (libare) with
them all, to enable him to utilise such knowledge, whenever occa-
sion arises, as it must needs do often (incidunt enim). In this plea
for a liberal education by the side of strictly professional training,
Tacitus again voices the sentiments of Cicero e. g. de orat. I 50,
217 f. at hoc ne philosophi quidem ipsi. . . dicere audent, qeome·
triam aut musicam philosophi esse quia Platonem omnes in illis
artibus praestantissimum fuisse fateantur. ac si iam placet omnes
artes oratori subiungere, tolerabilius est sic potius dicere . . . sit
boni oratoris multa auribus accepisse, multa vidisse, multa animo
et cogitatione, multa etiam legendo percucurrisse, neque ea ut sua
possedisse sed ut aliena libasse. Plat. Prot. 312 B.

‘comitem’ is so clearly the only proper solution of the compendium
bitem, preserved in A, the word is so preeminently suited to the context,
that the intrinsically and palaeographically improbable emendations of
others (p. 41) may be dismissed without further comment. Cp. Vahlen,
Comm. Momms. 1877 p. 667 and J ohn's note ad loc. As for Seek's absurd
conjecture (Hermes XII 509) and the far-reaching inferenee which he
draws from it—difficile est satiram non scribere.

32 haurire: See note c. 28 29. —libare, though common in this
figurative sense, is not elsewhere so used in Tacitus. Cf. e. g. Cic.
de orat. I 34, 159. 50 218 (cited above) Tusc. Disp. V 29, 82. Both
verbs combined in Cic. de div. I 49, 110 haustos animos et libatos
habemus. For a similar figure, cf. Sen. Ep. 36, 3 perbibere liberalia
studia, non illa quibus perfundi satis est, sed haec quibus tingendus
est animus. Observe the different expressions for the antithesis
between scientific knowledge on the one hand (haurire, compre-
hendebant, scientia) and superficial acquaintance on, the other
(libare, imbuebantur, notitia). ‘

This doubtless intentional symmetry is an additional proof of the correct-
ness of the reading libare.

ideoque-:itaque Very common in Quintilian e. g. X 1, 22
where see Peterson. In Tacitus only here and G. 26. Quo joins
an entire sentence as in c. 32 6 and 6 6, where other examples
from Tac. are cited.

33 iuris civilis scientiam: The necessity of a profound study of
civil law is repeatedly inculcated by Cicero e. g. de orat. I 36, 165.
