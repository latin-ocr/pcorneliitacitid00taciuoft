PROLEGOMENA. lxxv

one of the many clear proofs of the identity of Tacitus with the
author of the Dialogue.156

Full of enthusiasm for the sublime oratorical achievements of
his countrymen, he represents, in pointed contrast to Aper, the
uncompromising laudator temporis acti who is unable to see in the
eloquence of his time anything more than a deplorable corruption
and retrogression from the higher ideals and the chaster models of

 

which totally unfit the young and ambitious aspirant to forensic

the republican period. This remarkable change he primarily
3}- attributes to the prevailing laxity of home training and the per-
ι nicious educational methods of contemporary rhetorical schools,

ξ reputation for the practical duties of his profession. The close of
3} Messalla⁷s argument is unfortunately lost in the large lacuna after
ἐ 0. 35. In what follows, quite a different subject is under discus-
sion, which unquestionably points to another speaker. Can his
identity be determined ἱ)

The problem here presented is intimately or rather inextricably The speaker
connected with the question whether the existence of another of ⁰· 36'40 8·
x lacuna, not indicated in the MSS„ must be assumed3 and this in
5⁶³* -turn depends upon the degree of homogeneity inherent in these
⁸ closing Chapters, a point on which critics even to this day widely
differ. The problem is rendered still more complicated by the fact,
that even those scholars who postulate a second lacuna are not
agreed as to the place in the text to which it must be assigned,
some holding that the gap occurred before the words ‘Finierat
Maternus,' while others insist that it must be placed after ‘ admo-
vebant ' (c. 41 7). Still others deny the existence of any additional
lacuna whatever, attributing the whole argument from 0. 36-42 130
Maternus. Under these circumstances, it will again be expedient,
before discussing what Ι hold to ‘be the true solution of the diffi-
culties, to give a very brief historical survey of the phases through
which this controversy has passed.

As usual, it was a remark of Lipsius which started the problem
on its career, for to 0. 42 111113. 111 the first edition (1574) he in a
hapless moment jotted down these words: ‘Hinc colligere est
quam multa huic syntagmati desint. Neque enim initium sermonis

 

¹⁵⁶ Cp. Classen, Eos Ι p. 6 ff. The fact that Messalla himself repudiates the
name of an orator, though eminently entitled to it (c. 15 4 fii), indicates perhaps
that the soldier and man of affairs took up the career of an advocate more as an
avocation than a profession.
