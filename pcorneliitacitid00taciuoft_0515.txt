C. 40. 373

Cf. 0. 19 ext. 39 10 ffi—tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam:
‘No doubt, as has been said (viz. c. 3735 plures tamen bonos
[= valentiores] proeliatores bella quam pax ferunt sqq.) such
turbulent times produce a sturdier eloquence, . . . but.⁷ Sine dubio,
like ‘no doubt, sans doute, ohne Zweifel‚⁷ points back to some
thought already expres-sed (as here) or impHed, and it is thus
distinguished from ‘haud dubie⁷ which is merely a strong assev-
eration of a new thought. Hence Tacitus invariably adds an
adversative particle after ‘sine dubio‚' by way of modification or
qualification. Cf. Ag. 45 omnia s. d. . . . superfuere honori tuo,
tamen Ann. I 6 multa 0. (1. . . . Augustus . . . questus : ceterum
10 pacem s. d. post haec, verum cruentam ΙΙ 51 victa est s. d. lex,
sed XI 28 subibat s. d. metus . . . rursm. So also in Seneca (see
the exx. in Kleiber p. 68) and esp. common in Quintilian (cf.
Bonnell Lex. s. v.). This consistent usage would be alone sufficient
to dispose of Maternus as'the speaker in c. 36 ff„ for, 011 that
supposition‚ he would have made a very emphatic statement with-
out the slightest reservation, only to repeat it shortly after for
the purpose of neutralising its validity by a very important modi-
fication l——valentiorem eloquentiam: Cf. Tac. Ann. IV 21 orandi
validus. “

24 sicut indomitus ager habet quasdam herbas laetiores: laetus,
‘satisfactory, pleasing7⁷ is frequently applied to plants. e. g. Verg.
G. Ι 339 laetis operatus in herbis ΠΙ 494 laetis moriuntur in
herbis. Cf. the very similar thought in Eur. Hec. 588 Κ. εἰ γῆ μὲν
κακή l τυχοῦσα καιροῦ θεόθεν εὖ στάχυν φέρει.

25 1100 tanti rei publicae Gracchorum eloquentia fuit ut patere-
tur et leges: i. 0. Τ110 Roman people would gladly have dispensed
with the eloquence of the Gracchi, seeing that it was productive
only of pernicious laws. This disparaging criticism of the Grac-
chan reforms is in perfect accord with the view expressed by
Tacitus in a passage of the Annals (ΙΙΙ 27), where he even couples
the Gracchi with Saturninus 00 among ‘turbatores plebis.' —The
peculiarly emphatic position of ‘et leges ² is paralleled 111 Το0. Ag. 4
recepta populi Romani consuetudine ut haberet instrumenta servi-
tutis et reges.—et=etiam is found in the Dialogus only in two

carmina eorundem miratur. fecerunt enim et carmina. In the Ag.
