208 NOTES.

our text to speak of the ancient style of eloquence as ‘directa,’ he involves
himself in an irreconcilable contradiction, which cannot well be attributed
to the author. This conclusion, reached on internal grounds alone, is con-
firmed, in my judgment, by the significant ‘transposition variant ’ i'n our
MSS, which in the great majority of cases is a clear indication of inter-
linear glosses. The interpolation itself* was caused by the verb ‘flexisse,’
which naturally suggests a departure from a straiyht course. Cp. Am. Jour-
Phil. XII p. 448-450.

5 inscitia: The subtle distinctions drawn between ³ inscitia' and
³ inscientia' (R. V. I 165, note 118 Madvig, de fin. I 14, 46 Heraeus,
Tac. H. I 1 Woelfflin, Archiv III 565 Schmalz, Antii). I p. 688 f.)‚
while possibly true for Cicero, although the constant confusion of
both forms in our MSS. ought to warn us against any sweeping
generalisations, are apparently not applicable to Tacitus, He
seems to use both words quite promiscuously, with a decided pref·
erence, however, in the historica] writings for ‘inscitia' Lex.
Tac. s. v.

‘Aliud' is an evident emendation of Andresen (Emend. p. 119), for
‘illud' would lack a proper antecedent, the previous discussion turning

wholly upon the ancient type of eloquence, which Cassius Severus was the
first to abandon.

6 iudicio et intellectu: i. e. with a clear appreciation of> the
issues involved and a full under-standing] of the importance of the
change made necessary by the altered conditions of the taste and
culture of his time. As Cassius Severus was an intense admirer
of Cicero (cf. Sen. Contr. III praef. 15 f.), Aper's statement must
be taken cum grano salis. —namque is postpositive in Tacitus in
three other passages: Ann. I 5 II 43 IV 43. Schmalz, Antib. ΙΙ
110 errs greatly when he asserts that this particle is elsewhere
in Tac. invariably found before consonants. As a matter of fact, it
. precedes a vowel no fewer than 28 times (out of a total of 50)!
Dr. H. S. Π 162 also Wrongly quotes Virgil and Livy for the first
instances of ‘namque' in anastrophe. It is met with as early as
Catull. LXIV 383, where see Riese's note, and in prose in Varro
(ap. Gell. III 10). Cp. in general, Schmalz, Dr. ll. cc. R. V. III
286 note 431e and note to c. 6 7.

7 paulo ante dicebam: viZ. c. 18 8.--cum condicione temporum
et diversitate aurium: These two statements do not convey two
independent assertions, which indeed would be slightly illogical,
but the second is simply added, as one of the many phenomena in
