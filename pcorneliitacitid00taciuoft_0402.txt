260 NOTES.

to Pollio. Cf. Cic. Brut. 31, 121 quis enim uberior in dicendo
Platone . . . quis Aristotele nervosior, Theophrasto dulcior ?

The generally accepted reading ‘numerosior' was due to a wrong solu-
tion of a compendium, still preserved in cod. A. It is less probable than
‘nervosior' for two reasons: (1) Messalla's criticisms throughout turn
upon yeneral characteristics of style, and not upon technical or formal
qualities; (2) ‘numerosior' is too much at variance with Seneca’s judg-
ment on this point (cited c. 21 33) to render it plausible that Messalla should
deliberately single out this feature as particularly characteristic or praise-
worthy in Pollio's speecheS. John’s interpretation of Seneca's criticism

does not convince me.

splendidior Caesar: splendidus here apparently synonymous with
‘elegans, purus? Cf. Sen. Ep. 2100, 5 splendida tamen, quamvis
sumantur e medio 114, 14 nisi splendidis uti . . . necessaria atque
in usu posita vitare Cic. Brut. 88, 302 erat in verborum splen-
dore elegans, It was this quality which according to the unani-
mous verdict of antiquity especially distinguished Caesar's diction.

fulness of expression, which Aper l. c. censured, is in Messalla's
judginent not open to adverse criticism.—valentior: Cf. Cic. de
fato 6, 12 valens dialecticus. ——— Of the orators mentioned by Aper,
Messalla omits his ancestor, Messalla CorvinUS, for obvious reasons
Tacitus uses ‘prae se ferre '⁹ (Ag. 43 G. 39) as well as ‘praeferre ’ (Ann.

XIII 3). Andresen's emendation has been received into the text, because

praeseferunt was more easily corrupted into ferunt than praeferunt, the
apparent dittography of ‘se ’ causing the omission of ‘prae’

occurs in Cic. de orat. II 23, 94 alii (sc. historici) naturis differunt,
