Otho c. 9}ss That he died at an early age, perhaps about the same
time as Aper, is clear from Quintilian and c. 2 5 of the Tacitean
treatise.¹⁴5

The internal agreement between Tacitus and Quintilian, in the
high estimate of the oratorical 'abilities of Secundus, is remarkable
and seems to prove that his picture, as drawn by the former, is
a tolerably faithful likeness. He is coupled with Aper as among
the ‘celeberrima ingenia fori'3 his cautious disposition and. non-
combative nature, alluded to by Quintilian, is revealed in the very
first words put into his mouth by Tacitus (c. 2 4 ff. nihilne te . . .
fabulae malignorum terrent. . . sublatis si qua pravae interpreta-
tioni materiam dederunt, emitteres Catonem . . . securiorem ?) and
Quintilian’s statement regarding his overscrupulous care finds an
echo in the phrase in c. 39 9 euram et diliqentis stili anxietatem
contrariam expe1·imur.1⁴6 This characteristic seems to have occa-
sioned the charge that he lacked readiness and fluency of speech,1⁴⁷
a criticism which his devoted pupil does not really refute, when he
assures us ‘Secundo purus et pressus et, in quantum satis erat,
profluens sermo non defait) Combining all these featureS, one can-

14⁵ 88 A. D., the date given by Andresen and Peterson, Quint. X 1, 120 is
much too late, for apart from the fact that Secundus would still have been
living when the Dialogus was published, we should be involved in another
difficulty. For it is not likely that Tacitus came under the instruction of
Quintilian before the death of Secundus. Now, Tacitus must have completed
his studies before Agricola betrothed his daughter to him (77 A. ιλ). But if so,
what is more natural than to suppose that the young Tacitus, Secundus having
died shortly after 7 5 A. D.‚ became for a short time the pupil of Quintilian, who
had lived on ternis of the closest intimacy with his departed teacher P Both must
have been previously acquainted, and it is pleasant to think, albeit a mere
fancy, that Quintilian may have been an occasional participant in the ⁴ disputa-
tiones et arcana semotae dictionis,' which Tacitus so often had the privilege of
listening to in the house of Secundus (domi quoque . . . adsectabar). At all
eventS, we may say that the assumption of any later date for the death of
Secundus than the one here advocated, would at the same time necessitate the
rejection of the all but certain hypothesis that the future historiari had come
under the direct influence of the great rhetorician.

14⁶ It is no exaggeration to say that this statement is as eminently character-
istic of Secund11S‚ as it is absolutely out of place in the mouth of the poet
Maternus.
