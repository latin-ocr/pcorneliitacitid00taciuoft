Ch. 11-13. Maternus, in reply to Aper, points out that the alleyed
uselessness of poetry was not eoeemplified, in his case, at least, for one
of his own early dramas had been the primary cause of riddinq the
commonwealth of the powerful Vatinius, a success attended with qreater
reputation than could have been won »in the law courts, and as for
the eaeternal triumphs of the orator, by which Aper had laid such
store, they offer no sufficient inducement to the speaker to alter his
fioeed resolution to bid farewell to forensic duties forever (— c. 11).
Α contemplative life, on the other hand, passed amid the solitudo of
the silent qroves, instills a deep and lastiny joy. Poetry was, in fact,
the lanquaqe in which eloquence first clothed itselj, and from the
earliest period its devotees were beloved of the qods and the kinqs of
the earth, and their fame was ever as qreat as the renown acquired
by the orator (— 6. 12). The anxieties and tribulations, moreover‚
inseparable from an orator's career, when compared with the honored
and tranquil freedom vouchsafed to the disciple of the Muses, fully
justify his determination to pass the rest of his days under their
beniqn protection (--13 ext).

set. In the historical writings, ‘cum' is supplanted by ‘ubi‚’ in
similar phrases. Cp. Woelfflin, Philol. XXV 119. ——- acrius, ut sole-

. bat, et intento ore: acrius ‘earnest' opposed to remissus, (Cf. Cic.

Brut. 92, 317 Cotta et Hortensius, quorum alter remissus et lenis
. . . alter acer) pertains to the manner3 intento ore opposed to
subridens, to the speaker's facial expression, although intentus is
also used of the attitude of fixed attention. Cf. Ann. VI 50 idem

dum comitate XIII 3 triumphos maiorum enumerabat, intentus
ipse et ceteri . . . postquam ad providentiam sapientiamque flexit,
