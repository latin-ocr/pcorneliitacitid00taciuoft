O. 35. 36. 335

We have no criterion to decide between ‘ cogitant,' the reading of the X
class, and ‘ cogitare,' of Y. The former, however, looks suspiciously like
an attempt to round off the sentence. - ‘ nihil ’ is preferable to ‘ vel ’ (AB),
because more in keeping with the ἦθος of the passage. It is also supported
by the Ciceronian parallel. ⁶ vel ’ may have arisen out of ⁴ nil.'

Oh. 36-40 7. After the conclusion of Messalla's speech, Secundus
continues the discussion by drawinq attention to the fact that one of
the chief causes of the decline of eloquence may be found in the un-
trammeled freedom of speech and action enjoyed by democratic Athens
and republican Rome. In those days of popular autocracy, oratorical
ability was the only means to political honors, and the frequent sen-
sational trials of illustrious defenders, conducted in the inspirinq
presence of qreat multitudeS, could not but (sive an additional impetus
to the development of a superior eloquence. Finally the very mode of
leqal procedure, in the days of the Roman Republic, with its liberal
time allowance and its publicity, was also hiyhly conducive to the
yrowth of oratory. This happy state of affairs is contrasted with the
deplorable restrictions placed upon the orators of the speaker’s time.
The qreat chanqe was, it is admitted, the inevitable historical result
of a monarchical re‘qime, but the tranquillity and order thus secured,
however desirable in themselves, were necessarily subversive of the
very conditions essential to oratorical eoecellence.

36. 1' magna eloquentia sicut flamma etc.: This beautiful simile
was perhaps suggested by Cic. Brut. 24, 93 Quem (sc. Galbam) for-
tasse vis non ingeni solum sed etiam animi et naturalis quidam
dolor dicentem incendebat efficiebatque, ut et incitata et gravis et
vehemens esset orati03 dein cum otiosus stilum prehenderet motus-
que omnis animi tamquam ventus defecerat, flaccescebat oratio . . .
ardor animi non semper adest, isque cum consedit, omnis illa vis
et quasi flamma oratoris exstinguitur.

The evidently intended climax seems to me 'rudely destroyed, if we
accept the MS. reading ‘urendo clarescit.' Andresen translates ‘erglanzt
im Verzehren' (so similarly Peter) and adds by way of explanation ‘wie
die Flamme dann zugleich am hellsten glanzt, wenn sie am verheerend—
sten (ἱ) auftritt’ etc. I cannot admit either that this is physically true or
that ‘ urendo ' can have this meaning. In my judgnient, the brightness of
the fire is the immediate effect of ‘motibus excitatur,’ in which case the
thought ‘⁴ and it brightens as it burns '' is but an otiose repetition which I
am loth to attribute to the author. The proper climax is brought out by
the easy change of ‘clarescit’ into ‘calescit,’ i. e. ‘Eloquence like fire is
