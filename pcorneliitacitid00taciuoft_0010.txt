viii PREFACE.

sequendum est non quo invitat,'' and believe that no really
irrelevant matter has been allowed to intrude. In spite of
this, the commentary may possibly appear to some as out of
proportion to the brevity of the treatise itself. Its bulk might,
indeed, have been considerably reduced, but I deemed it more
expedient to cite most illustrative passages in full, being ’
convinced that but few readers will command the leisure to
look up the quotations for themselves, even if they had the
sources within immediate reach.

Of more recent editors, I desire to acknowledge my indebt-
edness particularly to G. Andresen and O. John. The former
has also kindly communicated to me the valuable gleanings of
his recollation of the Vaticani. As Ι have been compelled to
dissent from Andresen’s opinions more frequently than from
those of any other scholar, it may not be out of place to state

ι that the detailed attention everywhere accorded to his views is

intended as a sincere tribute to the high rank which he
deservedly occupies among Tacitean scholars of to-day. J ohn's
contributions have also been a great help to me, andI am the
more glad to make this acknowledgment, because his learned,
acute and instructive notes have hitherto not received the
recognition which they merit.

In conclusion, I can but inadequately acknowledge the
depth of my gratitude and obligations to my friend, Prof.
Chae. Ε. Bennett, of Cornell University, who has not only
kindly favored me with many valuable suggestionS, but has
also with the greatest care read every line of proof in its
various stageS.

Wm. Mass-Arndt, of Chicago University, while the equally
exhaustive Indeoe Locorum was compiled by Mr. Homer J.
