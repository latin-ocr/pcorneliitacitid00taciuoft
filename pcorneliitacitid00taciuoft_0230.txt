jective genitives, for these are theoretically always resolvable into
a verb with an obj. or an adv. clause.

The inserted clause ⁶ vel ad voluptatem iucundius' is rendered necessary
by the context. The eye of the scribe glancing from one ‘vel ad’ to another
occasioned the omission. While iucundius or honestius are not intrinsically
obJ'ectionable, quid enim dulcius at the beginning of c. 6 strongly favors the
reading adopted in the text. —The cod. D, which is singularly free from
interpolations, has famam after imperii, but in parenthesis. This possibly
points to a lacuna which was falsely supplied and afterwards bracketed, as
it is not found in other MSS. The original reading may have been
gloriam, cf. c. 11 12.

19 ad utilitatem vitae, etc: For similar utilitarian sentiments
cp. the debate in the senate which Tac„ in a famous passage (Anu.
XI 5—7), reports, touching the reenforcement of the lex Cincia ‘qua
cavetur antiquitus ne quis ob causam orandam pecuniam donumve
accipiat.' 7 quem illum tanta superbia esse ut aeternitatem famae
spe praesumat ? Usui et rebus subsidium parari . . . nihil a quoquam
expeti nisi cuius fructus ante providerit. Cf. also Sen. de clem. Ι 3, 2
· qui hominem voluptati donant, quorum omnia dicta factaque ad uti-
, litates suas spectant. Ep. 48, 2 nec potest quisquam beate degere
qui se tantum intuetur, qui omnia ad utilitates suas convertit. Vitae
belongs to consilia. ——The joining of an adjective with ‘ad' to a
kindred substantive is Ciceronian usage. Cp. Hand, Turs. I 106.

20 derigenda: On this orthography, cf. Munro, Lucret. VI 823
Heraeus, H. IV 16 Pfitzner 1. c. p. 48. -On a similar chiasmus at
the close of an enumeration cf. c. 26 22 varietate eruditionis et
lepore urbanitatis et ipsarum virium robore. The artistic balancing
of groups of words and clauses is very conspicuous throughout the
whole of Aper-'s speech and this design is the direct cause of the
tautological or pleonastic collocations which critics have so often
censured.

Examples are not wanting, where an indefinite subject must be supplied
from the context. Cp. note c. 22 21. But as s and t are scarcely dis-
tinguishable in minuscles, there is no need for adopting the ‘difficilior lectio’
ferat for feras. So possis below in all MSS. (except D) which the advocates
