II 3, 9. —hac tua: This collocation is very common in the D. e. g.
0. 10 9 hunc meum 21 7 42 4 15 3 hunc tuum 1 7 0111 . . tuae=sed
huic . . tuae 13 12 hac sua 16 12 hanc nostram 16 15 hac vestra and
H. II 47 hanc virtutem vestram. It is apparently colloquial usage
and therefore not unsuited to a conversational or epistolary style.
Cicero has but one instance in the speeches (pro Lig. 35 hi tui). In
Quint. it is very rare (e. g. Ι 3, 3 1110 1110113) but in Pliny's letters,
as we are not surprised to observe, it is correspondingly frequent.

2 frequens et adsidua: John well remarks that the interposition
of ‘nobis' strongly favors the predicative meaning of these words
rather than the usual interpretation which regards them as one of
the very numerous instances of fullness or redundancy of expres-
sion in the D. This view is also in a measure confirmed by
Cicero who (pro Plane. 8 ext.) has the phrase ‘adsidua frequentia.'
‘To dispute repeatedly and earnestly has almost become a habit
with us! ’

3 vertisset with the force of a middle is particularly frequent in
Tac. e. g. Ag. 31 nisi felicitas in socordiam vertisset G. 31 in con-
sensum vertit H. IV'27 Ann. XIII 37 and other exx. cited by
Boetticher Lex. Tac. 3. v. Not uncommon in Livy e. g. I 53, 6 II
3, 3, where see Weissenborn.—On the dozen different significa-
tions which this verb has in Τ., cp. Gerber, De usu praepo& p. 17. —
The imperf. in an unreal condition followed by a pluperfect (so
again in 0. 10 23 31 . . dedissent . . non paterer) ³ I should (now) be
disturbed, had not our disputes (long ago) become’ presents no
departure from classical usage. Weinkauff⁷s note p. 114 is, there-
fore, both superfluous and misleading. Cp. Roby II p. 224. —On
nec-et, see 0. 2 10.-agitare et insequi: Synonymic collocations
are particularly abundant in Aper's speeches and, may have been
designed to give an individualistic color to his style. Nearly all of
them can be paralleled from CicerO, where they are, however, very
often found in the inverse order, a fact which in many instances
betrays direct indebtedness on the part of Tacitus, Cf. 0. 1 14
