the previous conversation. Messalla expresses his sincere delight
on learning that his friends, as indeed befits men 01 11116 611111116,
employ their leisure hours in discussing subjects not directly con-
nected with their profession, and compliments the eminent lawyer
Secundus 101 1113 11131011631 16363161163, while Aper, no less illus-

* tricus as an advocate, is ironically praised 101 1101 allowing his

forensic duties to alienate him from the theoretical and scholastic
exercises 01 modern 11161011613113.130 Τ1113 1331 utterance (otium
suum mavult novorum rhetorum more quain veterum oratorum con-
sumere), though apparently nothing more than a harmless, ironical
⁷ fiing at Aper's fondness for the rhetorical practices 01 1113 111116,
which Messalla held in very low estimation (see 0. 35), 13 01 para-
mount importance in the dramatic development of the Dialogue.
For, by calling forth Aper’s rejoinder: Non desinis, Messalla,
vetera tantum et antiqua mirari, nostrorum autem studia inridere
atque contemnere . . . cum neminem hoc tempore oratorem esse con-
tenderes, the question which is to form the main theme 01 discus-
sion is with wonderfully artless art brought upon the tapis, It in
turn naturally leads to the desire 01 learning the reasons 101· this

vast difference between the oratory, 01 1116 past and the present

(c. 15 11 f.)‚ 3 difference which, in Messalla's opinion, was not
brought about by any healthy progress, but by the gradual abandon-
ment 01 1011161 standards. The conflict having thus been prepared,
and a distribution 01 1116 contesting speakers arranged, the debate

begins. Aper, who has to stand up single-handed against a united

opposition, opens the discussion (6. 16 14) by a casuistical argument

ἵ concerning the relative meaning 01 1116 161111 ‘antiqui' and its

proper applicability to the orators 01 1116 Roman republic, and then
’ passes on to a scathing indictment 01 113 greatest representatives
and a glowing eulogy 01 1116 characteristic features 01 modern
eloquence.

Messalla thereupon takes up the cudgels 101 his beloved
‘ancients,⁷ so disparagingly criticised by Aper, but, being recalled
to the main theme at issue, gives, what he regards as the principal
reason 101 1116 decline 01 eloquence. The close 01 his argument
is lost. The next speaker, wh0, as we shall show below, is
Secundus, supplements, according to the agreement made in 6.

1³0 Maternus is not likewise commended 101· 1116 versatility 01 his 1111616313,

because, though he too was an advocate by profession, his poetical predilections
were 100 well known 10 have special attention drawn 10 1116111.
