 

PREFACE.

 

ΤΗΕ present edition of the Dialogus de Oratoribus was begun
as far back as 1888. Since that time Ι have spared no effort
to read and carefully examine, sine ira et studiO, everything
that has been written upon this earliest production of Rome’s
greatest historian. But while the abundant tralatician material,
accumulated since the days of Lipsius, has not been neglected,
I have mainly relied upon my own extensive collectanea, and
for the style of the treatise upon the admirable Lexicon
Taciteum, which had not yet been sufficiently far advanced to
be of real service to previous editors of the Dialogue.

In the Proleyomena I have endeavored to give an exhaustive,
but at the same time succinet and lucid, treatment of all the ,
interesting and difficult problems which the Dialogus presentS,
and I venture to hope that my solutions of them may convince
even those critics who have hitherto espoused other views
or drawn different conclusions from those advanced in the
succeeding pages.

The Adnotatio Oritiea aims at completeness, no emendation of
any intrinsic value‚ published since Michaelis' fundamental
recensio, being omitted3 the readings of subsequent editions
are, for the convenience of the student, also added. My text-
critical attitude and the arguments for the readings received
into the text are fully set forth in the chapter on the MSS. and
in the Critical Notes. ¹

In writing the Exeqetieal Commentary I have constantly kept
in mind the golden precept of Seneca: ⁶⁶ Quo ducit materia
