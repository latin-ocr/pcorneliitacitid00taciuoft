only Vitruv. 180, 23 dabit imitari. — tribunatus praeturas: On
these pluraIS, see Draeger²s lists H. S. I p. 11 ff. 19.

10 in alvo oritur: Cf. c. 29 10 vitia paene in utero matris con-
cipi mihi videntur. Alvus =uterus (Cf. Paulus-Festus: venter
feminae). Tacitus even uses uterus for alveus in Ann. II 6 lato
uter0, a ἅπ. εῖρ.

All our MSS. read alio with the exception of the cod. Vindob. which has
albo (i. e. alvo and so Pithoeus). Few passages in the Dialogus have been

burdened with more conjectures, of which those given in the adnotatio
critica are but a selection (For earlier attempts to emend the unintelligible
alio, see Schulze, in Exc. II p. 168-171 of his edition, Walther, Tac.
Vol. IV p. 245-47). Andresen in despair writes natalibus paritur. This
emendation and numerous others depart too far from the MSS. reading to
merit serious attention. The conjecture which has met with most favor
is Ritter's ‘in aliquo' and yet this reading has nothing in its favor, save its
palaeographical simplicity. For (1) aliquo is quite out of place being too
vague and indefinite. (2) The meaning which Ritter and his followers
attribute to the phrase in aliquo is made possible only by investing the
preposition with an emphasis which it never has or can have.

10 codicillis: ‘Cabinet order, letters patent! So Ag. 40 codi-
cillos quibus ei (sc. Agricolae) Suria dabatur tulisse. Ann. XIII

13 non solum—sed etiam: Always undivided e. g. c. 16 33 20 14
21 32 24 4 Α1111. IV 35 except c. 22 19, where, however, non ea
solum is followed by sed without etiam. Cf. note to c. 2 6.-
Vacuus is generally opposed to occupatus, cf. Tac. H. IV 17 arri-
perent vacui occupatos and Peterson, ad Quint. X 1, 32.

Iuvenes et adulescentes, as all our MSS. with the exception of B have it,
destroys the contrast intended by the author (non solum—sed etiam).
Nor is the generally accepted reading vacuos et adulescentes more satis-
factory, for here again adulescentes are unwarrantably identified with vacui.

The proper antithesis is brought about by reading ‘iuvenes vacuos et adule-
scentes.' Vacuos, as its position shows, belongs to both nouns (cf. note
