From this it appearS, then, that the archetypon of the Ottoboni-

Α anus was corrected by an unknown hand after the Vindobonensis
. had been copied from it, and in this emended state Fontanus or

the scribe of the Leidensis used. it, the readings adopted being all

genuine.

There remains the question as to the interrelationship of CDA

” and the very frequent agreement of D with the X class. This
problem has, in my judgment, also been solved by Scheuer. For
54⁵ a glance at the readings given on p. cxxxi f. will show that CAD
,ιῖ form still another independent group (designated by Scheuer as y2)
*ζ of Y. As for D, which Michaelis regarded as the best represent-
ative of the Y class, for the reasons given, its frequent agreement
¹· with ΑΒ280 is now seen to be due to the fact that its immediate
ἦ, archetypon (γ’) had been corrected out of some member of the X
’ἦ family, after ΟΔ had already been copied. The clear proof of this
' is furnished by the following significant variants z

The interdependence of our MSS„ as finally determined, may be
represented by the subjoined family-trec, the arrows indicating in

though derived from different families‚ may be accounted for ε
