denoted the objections made by defendant against the statements
of the plaintiff which were inserted in the praetor's edict. The

p. 235-242.-M. Tullio: Cicero made two speeches (72 sl B. c.) in
behalf of this Tullius against P. Fabius, one of Sulla's veterans
who had destroyed the plaintiff⁷s villa near Thurii. The first
speech is entirely lost and the second only preserved in some
palimpsest fragmentS.— Aulo Caecina: This extant speech was
delivered in 69 B. c. before the ³ reciperatores,⁷ and deals with an
intricate will case. Its technical nature is expressly alluded to by
Cicero himself in Orat. 29, 102: tota mihi causa pro Caecina de
verbis interdicti fuit: res involutas definiendo explicavimus, ius
civile laudavimus, verba ambigua distinximus, where see Sandys'
excellent note-Among the fifty-five complete orations of Cicero
which have come down to us, the pro Caecina ranks 11th in point
of bulk, so that the epithet ‘inmensa' is clearly not 'so great an
exaggeration as Peter thinks, especially as it is not likely that
very many of the numerous speeches still accessible to Aper
exceeded the pro Caecina in length. Fortunat. 107, 30 Η., also
groups these two speeches together: cum exemplo multarum legum
probamus praesentem quoque legem ita sentire ut nos defendimus,
sicut M. Tullius fecit pro M. Tullio et pro A. Caecina.— praecurrit

Cf. Quint. IX 4, 138 in argumentis citati atque ipso etiam motu
celeres sumus? in locis ac descriptionibus fusi ac fluentes—colore
sententiarum: color, corresponding to Gk. χρῶμα, in its technical
post-Aug. sense denotes ‘the varnish, gloss or color by which the
accused endeavors to palliate, the accuser to aggravate, the allowed
facts of the case! These ‘colores' were often collected by rhetori-
cians. Thus the elder Seneca, for instance, arranges his Controversiae
under the three heads, sententiae, divisiones and colores. Cp. Mayor,
Iuv. VII 155. But as ‘sententiae' is clearly distinguished from
‘color' (cf. also Quint. IX 1, 18), it is best to take the word in our
passage in its classical signification of ‘beauty, embellishment!
The phrase ‘color sententiarum' would then correspond to ‘color
