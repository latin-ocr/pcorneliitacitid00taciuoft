160 NOTES.

15 adligati omni adulatione: Marcellus and Crispus, in the eyes
of Maternus, have lost all personal independence by their slavish
obsequiousness toward the Emperor. Marcellus was dead when
these bitter words were written, and Crispus was not likely to have
been in favor in the reign of Titus. (lp. Proleg. xxx -- ‘ adulatio'
is perhaps of more frequent occurrence in Tacitus than in any
earlier writer.

The great maJ'ority of editors 1611186 to accept Walther's emendation
omni (cu ABE cum—CDV). It is, however, absolutely certain, as a glance
at the variants in c. 2 14 might have shown : omni eruditione (omni—CEAV
cu—ABD), for here there can be no doubt as to the genuine reading. A
similar false solution 61 6 compendium gave 1186 to an unintelligible ⁴ omne ’

17 liberti, sc. principis, This statement, as Andresen observes,
is a thrust at Aper, who (c. 7) had mentioned the defence of the
Emperor's liberti, as among the most honorable occupations of an
orator. On the ‘liberti' under the Empire see note to c. 7 7.—
dulces‚ ut Vergilius ait, Musae: Cited from Georg. II 475 f. Me
verum primum dulces ante omnia Musae Ι quarum sacra fero in-
genti percussus amore Ι accipiant—In the phrase ‘ut ait,' the
subject usually follows the verb. The inverse order, as here (and
again in Tac. but without ut ε Α1111. XI 3 XV 69), 18 not rare in the
Silver Age. Cf. Liv. XXX 26, 9 sicut Ennius ait Varr. R. R. I

Demosthenes ait. Cp. Schmalz, Antib. I p. 124.

18 sollicitudinibus et curis: Ι11 inverse order in Cic. ad Att.

19 in* illa sacra illosque fontes ierant: The preposition does not
signify ‘into,⁷ which would involve an absurdity, but it may be
taken in the sense of ad, ‘towards,' Germ. ¹ an,' as in Prop. III 16, 17

πῦρ ἐς νῆα φέροντα and esp. analogous to our passage K 107 ἦ μέν
ἆρ’ ἐς κρήνην κατεβήσετο καλλιρέεθρον. Inasmuch, however, as
the sanctuaries of the Muses were situated on high places, it
seems far preferable to interpret in=‘up towards' a signification
which it also frequently has. E. g. c. 10 19 in ipsam arcem
eloquentiae ferat 19 16 in caelum laudibus ferebatur Ann. XII
