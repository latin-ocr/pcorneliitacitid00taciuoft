we are assured by Baehrens and Andresen, is not elsewhere found
in the sense of ‘sacra loca' and the dictionarieS, it is true, do not
cite any instances. Nevertheless examples are by no means lacking
even in Tacitus, where this word, as shown by the context, can
have no other signification, while in others there is, at least, no
obstacle to its being interpreted in a local sense. Cf. Tac. H. ΠΙ

vatum carmen affero nostrum. The shrines of the Muses, as

. remarked‚ were generally located on the tops of mountains and in

 

. the immediate neighborhood of springs, whence poets were said to
drink inspiration. So Mt. Helicon, with the sacred springs of Aga-
nippe and Hippocrene (Paus. I'X 29, 3), Mt. Parnassus with the
Castalian spring (Plut. de Pyth. orac. 402 C). Numa Pompilius
dedicated a grove to the Muses next to a sacred fountain, because
they were believed to associate there with the nymph Egeria (Liv.

I 21 Plut. Num. 13). Cf. also Mayor, ad Iuv. III 13 nunc sacri
fontis nemus et delubra locantur.

From the above it must be clear that the passage is entirely sound, neither
the preposition nor ⁴ sacra ’ nor ‘ fontes ' presenting the slightest difficulty.
On the other hand, the generally received reading of Ritter (for even Peter
and John J'oin ‘in’ with ‘fontes’ by assuming a kind of zeugma of the prep-
osition)‚ besides being based upon a palpable misinterpretation, is open to
other insuperable objections. (1) The variation of the preposition violates
a stylistic usage of Tacitus, pointed out c. 10 25. (2) Τ110 anastrophe of
the preposition is confined to the later writings of Tacitus (cp. Woelfflin,
Phil. XXV 116), and even in these, ad in anastrophe after a pronoun is
extremely rare. Cp. H. C. Maue p. 71 A. Gerber, Progr. Gluckstadt 1871,
and Am. Jour. Phil. XII p. 333-5.
