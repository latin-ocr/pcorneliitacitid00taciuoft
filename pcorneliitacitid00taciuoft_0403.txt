C. 25. 261

to mention the disputed passage in Ann. IV 33 tum quod antiquis
oratoribus rarus obtrectator, on which see Furneaux and Ioh.
Muller, Beitr. ΙΙΙ p. 46 ff„ Ι recognise in Ag. 34 quos quod tandem
invenistis, non restiterunt sed deprehensi sunt, a very similar
construction—invicem se obtrectaverunt: Invicem on the analogy
01 ‘inter se,' its 010881001 equivalent, is generally used without
an additional ‘ se' and so invariably elsewhere in Tacitus, barring
one exception in Ag. 6 invicem se anteponendo. 811111101· examples
are by no means rare in Silver Latin e. g. Plin. Ep. III 7 , 15 011111
invicem se mutuis exhortationibus amici ad amorem immortalitatis
exacuunt Pomp. Mela III 52 se invicem infestant Ps. Quint. Decl.
p. 194, 25. 258, 6 R. Aci-ost. Plaut. Men. 10 ibi se cognoscunt
fratres postremo invicem. Cp. Hartmann‚ Archiv ΠΙ 290 and esp.
Thielmann, ibid. VII 362-366, 388, also Schmalz, Antib. p. 718 1.

Nipperdey (Rhein. Mus. XIX 571 1. and Ann. XIV 17) to whom the
above passages were unfortunately unknown, refused to accept ‘invicem se ²
as correct Latin. The very awkward exception in the Agricola he promptly
disposes 01 by gravely laying down the rule that ‘se' may be added, 101·
the sake 01 0100111088, 11 the verb can also govern a dative case, a rule which
its author abandons at once by deleting ‘se' in our passage, apparently
forgetting that ‘obtrectare’ with the 000. 01 the person in place 01 the
dative is found only here.

24 et· · -epistulis eorum: Cf. 0. 18 22 ff. On the affirmative
use 01 ‘ et,⁷ very common in TacitUS, see LeX. Tac. S. v, p. 103.

25 hominum ‘human nature.' In this sense, also in Tac. H.
IV 74 Ann. I 61. Cp. humanae infirmitatis vitium, below.

26 Asinium: Asinius Pollio, though well-known as a malevolent
critic (cp. Teuffel §221, 6) had not been included by Aper in c.
18 20 to which passage Messalla expressly refers. But this incon-
sistency, as Vahlen, Prooem. 1878s9 p. 6 has pointed out, is no
more open to criticism than the similar instances 01 incongruity in
0. 3 20 01· 25 31, where see notes.

‘et invidere' has generally been athetised as an explanatory gloss to
‘livere,’ but, as John, Correspbl. p. 31 has convincingly shown, the two
verbs are by no means synonymous and, even if they were so, the deletion
of one 01 them would not be justifiable, in view of the fondness 101· syno-
nymic collocations which characterises this treatise. The genuineness 01
‘invidere' is, moreover, clearly demonstrated by the observation that
‘ceteri’ and also ‘alii‘ invariably refer back to a substantive antecedent
which, with the reading hitherto adopted, could only be supplied from the
Infinitive. This difficulty is disposed 01 by the easy correction of ‘livere '
into ⁴ livore.’
