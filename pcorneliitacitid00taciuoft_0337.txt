canorum oratorem et volubilem et satis acrem . . . et vehementem

Lit. §136,4.—aut‚ does not here introduce an alternative, but is
practically equivalent to a copulative conjunction. Cf. c. 11 13

Recent editors, with the laudable exception of Wolff, insert Ο. Laelio aut
on the basis of Messalla's answer in 0. 25 32 quod ad Servium Galbam et
C. Laelium attinet et si quos alios antiquiorum Aper agitare non destitit.
But this would consistently require the insertion 01 C. Carbonem in the
later passage, a suggestion actually made by Classen, thus furnishing a
unique instance of what may be called a reciprocal corruption! Vahlen,
Prooem. 1878-9 p. 5 f. has, moreover, drawn attention to two passages
which show an analogous negligence, if such it be. Cf. 0. 21 1. with 0.
26 24 1., where Messalla does not conform in his answer to Aper's line 01
argument, and again c. 25 15, where Asinius is added to the detractors 01
Cicero, although omitted by Aper, c. 18 22.

4 merito antiquos vocaverimus: This marks the complete aban-
donment of Aper's interpretation of ‘antiquus' advocated with
an apparent show of sincere conviction in c. 16 isff. His final
retreat had already been prepared by c.- 17 2, where see note.

impoliti etc.: The intentional accumulation 01 opprobrious epithets
serves the purpose 01 emphasising the low opinion which the
speaker has 01 111636 early orators. These rhetorical synonyms
are often variously combined in Cicero and Quint. e. g. de orat. I 8,
32. 49, 214 ΙΠ 14, 51. 48, 185 Orat. 5, 20. 6, 20. 11, 36 Brut. 21,

Lex.), Cp. the commentators 11. cc. and Causeret 1. c. p. 175. Still
other synonyms are ‘asper, tristis, severus, ieiunus' opposed to
‘ornatus, elegans, politus, nitidus, limatUS, laetus.' informis, also
