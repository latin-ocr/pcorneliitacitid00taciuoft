136133 viriS. Insanus designatos the senseless noise made by the
populace; lubricum the uncertainty and danger attending forensic
pleading.

21 famamque pallentem: Fame is here said to cause palenesS,
because of the instability and transitoriness of forensic reputation,
which is wholly dependent upon the fickle favor of the populace.
For the thought, cf. Sen. Ep. 95, 57 f. Non contingit tranquillitas

regimine utentibus, fama.— For the metonymy (cause for effect),

from Tacitus, we have metonymy and oxymoron combined: H. ,

John and Andresen take fama to mean ⁶ town-talk, popular opinion,’ on
the ground that ‘glory’ is equally sought both by orator and by poet.
But this interpretation conflicts with the character of the speaker 38 drawn
by Tacitus, for Maternus disdainfully ignores the gossip of the multitude
(see 6. 2. 3) and by the use of the epithet ‘ pallentem ' simply distinguishes
the ‘bubble reputation’ of the orator, acquired amid surroundings which
place him in a perpetual state of worry and excitement‚ from the stable
and lasting fame vouchsafed to the poet. ‘ Palantem,' which John accepts,
would of course be a very suitable attribute of ⁶ fama' in the sense which
he erroneously attributes to it here.

trepidus: On the adj. for the adverb, see note 6. 4 4.—non me

--nec· · · excitet: ‘non' is used in place of ‘ne' to emphasise
³ me,' some phrase like ‘sed alii' being understood. Cf. Tac. Ann.
I 11 11611 ad unum omnia deferrent, where Nipp. also cites examples
from Cic. pro Cluent. 57, 155 311(1 Liv. IX 34, 15. In the poets
(e. g. Veng. Aen. XII 78) and post-Augustan prose-writers this
usage is common. — For ‘nec' with the optative or hortative sub·
