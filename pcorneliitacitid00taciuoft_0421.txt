c. 28. ’ 279 ’

writers e. g. Plin. Pan. 95, 1 Florus III 19, 11 circa apprehenden-
dum eum multitudo contendit3 with gerund, once in Quint. IV 5,
6 plus eloquentia circa (=ad) movendum valet.-Observe also
that a substantive with gerundive, when governed by a preposition,
serves as an idiomatic substitute for an abstract noun. In Tacitus
the construction is quite common with ‘ ad' 3 once with ‘ob' : Ann.
XI 53 with ‘circa ' only here. — educandos formandosque ‘ bringing
up and rearing of children.' ³ Educare ' of physical training seems
to occur in but one other passage viz. Varro, de liberis educandis,
cited by Nonius s. v. ‘educit obstetrix, educat nutrix, instituit
paedagogus, docet magister. The nearest approach to this usage
elsewhere is perhaps to be found in Cic. Orat. 13, 42 where see
Sandys and Brut. 58, 211 cited below. -On the significance of this
parallelism, see Prolegomena p. cii. ‘formare' with a personal
object is poetic, but frequent in post-Augustan prose. See the exx.
cited by Kleiber p. 60.

13 pridem ‘ formerly ' So Cic. ad fam. V 6, 2 quod ad me pridem
scripseras. Especially common in Iustinus e. g. V 7, 12 XII 6, 7
XXXI 3, 10, but in Tac. only”here.-—suus cuique filius: Peter
interprets this phrase to mean that the boy was educated at home
and not in company with other children. But Tacitus is here
clearly speaking of infancy, as shown by ‘cellula . . . nutricis'
and Quintilian (I 2, 1) too does not discuss the question ‘utilius
domi an in scholis erudiatur’ until ‘iam paulatim accrescere puer
et exire de qremio et discere serio incipiat.7

14 emptae nutricis ‘hired wet-nurse,' τίτθη. On this meaning
of the word, see Wilkins, Cic. de orat. II 39, 162. On the function
of the nurse in the household of the ancients, cp. I. H. Krause,
Gesch. der Erziehuuy . . . bei den Griech.. u. Rism. p. 394-398.—
in gremio ac sinu matris: The paramount importance herc attached
to the mother’s own nursing finds a very significant echo in later
utterances of Tacitus. Cf. Ag. 4 mater Iulia Procilla fuit, rarae
castitatis: in huius sinu indulgentiaque educatus and especially G.
20 sua quemque mater alit nec aut ancillis aut nutricibus delequntur.
The same is recorded of Cato’s wife by Plut. Cat. Mai. 20, 5.
Cf. alSO Plut. Serb. 2 τραφεὶς δὲ κοσμίως ὑπὸ μητρὶ χήρᾳ and
Plin. Ep. III 3, 3 adhuc illum pueritiae ratio intra contubernium
tuum (viz. Cornelia Hispulla) tenuit. Op. especially the long dis-
course of Favorinus reported by Gell. N. A. XII 1 and Ps. Plut.
