xxii PROLEGOMENA.

Dial. in only two codices and of these one contains only Tacitean·
writings l If any such transference had taken place, it was far more
likely that the name of Suetonius would have become attached to
our treatise, the more so as the Suetonian fragment also dealt with
purely literary topics. Nay,> more, on Haase’s theory, we should
be compelled to conclude that, inasmuch as the Germania, preserved
in but a single MS„ almost invariably follows the Dialogus, the
name of Tacitus was thence transferred from the treatise which
preceded 1 Again, it must be observed, that many a work handed
down to us under a definite name, would have to pass as ἀδέσποτον,
if critics can with impunity discredit an otherwise unimpeachable
tradition, simply because it is based upon a single MS. and happens
to conflict with a pet hypothesis. In the present instance, such
reasoning would endanger the authenticity of the Germania and
the fragment of Suetonius no less than that of the Dialogus. The
archetypon, moreover, can be traced at least as far back as the
nintlz century, all direct knowledge of Tacitus, never extensive at
any time, having been wholly lost for the six centuries preceding
the rediscovery of his works.1⁸ But the nearer we approach the
historian⁷s own time, the more precarious becomes the supposition
of Lipsius and Haase, the more intrinsically trustworthy the testi-
mony of the archetypon.
Such being the case, we must insist with Steiner and Jansen,
that the evidence in favor of Tacitean authorship furnished by the
MSS„ is an argument of adamantine strength which can only be
demolished by contrary proofs, overwhelming in their number and
of convincing validity. It therefore follows that every examination
of other objections that have been brought forward since the time
of Lipsius must start out with the presumption that the Dialogus
de oratoribus is as genuine a work of Tacitus as the Germania, the
MS. history of both being identical.
The dramatgc The opponents of the genuineness of the Dialogue justify their

the title is never given and Cassiodorius Senator, the last to cite Tacitus’ name
for a passage taken from it (6. 45), does so only at second hand. ‘ hoc quodam
