the fact that these modern orators are not expres-ely mentioned as
the men with whom this close union is established. But this was
not essential, because Aper's hearers clearly understand that the
propriety of the term ‘antiquos ac veteres' was not called into
question, unless applied to Cicero and his immediate contempora-
ries, and so similarly, it is to them only that ³ ex horum oratorum
fama' in the succeeding chapter can be made to refer.

For this reason, the emendation of ‘recentes' for ‘veteres' must be
reJ'ected, quite apart from the circumstance that it is objectionable on other
grounds, for (1) ‘recentes' would require the additional change of ‘ac’
into ‘ aut' ; (2) the modern orators are not so designated in the Dialogus,
being called either ‘horum (nostrorum) temporum diserti (c. 1 5 14 15 36 4)
‘novi rhetores’ (c. 14 24) or ‘nostri' (c. 20 21 23 10 26 7); Cp. John's excel-
lent and convincing note to this passage.

29 adgnoscere: In c. 3 9 and 7 19 it signified ‘to recognise by
the sense of sight.⁷ Here the word is used of sense—perception
generally, or, more particularly, with reference to the sense of
hearing. No other instance of this latter meaning seems to occur.
—coniungere et copulare: The same verbs are combined in Cic.
de orat. Ι 51, 222 coniungi (so Dr. J. S. Reid, iungi—MSS. edd.)
copularique. ‘Adgnoscere⁷ stands in causa] relation to ‘coniun-
gere,' hence joined by ‘ac’3 the synonyms coni. and cop. by ‘et.'
So similarly c. 32 5 scientia nos ornat atque . . . eminet et excellit.

18. 1 praedixi: ‘ premised.' In this sense chiefly post-Augustan
and remarkably frequent in Velleius. Kleiber p. 63, who cites
many examples, is, however, wrong in supposing that this meaning
was introduced by Velleius, for we find it repeatedly in Terence
e. g. And. IV 4, 54 hoc primum praedico tibi. In Cicero it is
used as a synonym of ‘vaticinari' or of ‘praeciperes—fama
gloriaque laus: These synonyms are very frequently grouped
together. Cf. e. g. Cic. Verr. I 17, 51 pro Arch. 11, 26 de fin. ΙΙΙ
17, 57 where ‘gloria' is distinguished from ‘bona fama.⁷ Sall.

2 adquiritur: Cp. Tac. H. II 76 cui summum decus adquiritur.
—in medio sitam: ἐν μέσῳ κεῖται, i. e. the glory that Cicero and
his contemporaries shed upon their age belongs equally to the
present, because of the close temporal proximity between the two
