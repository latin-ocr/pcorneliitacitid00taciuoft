others take ‘nostris' :nostrae aetatis, but this interpretation in no way
removes the difficulty, for the philosophie sects referred to had long been
extinct in the speaker’s day (hence ‘more vetere’). Cf. Cic. de nat. deor.
I 5, 11.

saepe celebrato: I have been unable to verify Wolff's assei-tion
that this pleonasm is frequent.

11 igitur: On the position, cf. note c. 3 1.—non laudationem
antiquorum etc.: This statement is quite incompatible with the
supposition that c. 36 ff. are a part of the speech of Maternus.
Cp. Prolegomena pp. lxxv—lxxxiv.

The accidental omission of ‘in’ before ‘tantum’ is intrinsically more
probable than its intentional insertion by some scribe. Cf. c. 32 23 cur in
tantum ab eloquentia antiquorum recesserimus (no variants). G. 45 in
tantum . . . a servitute degenerant and note c. 2 13.

cum praesertim, ‘ and that t00, although' On this peculiar use

of ‘ cum praesertim,' cf. Madvig, Cic. de fin. II 8, 25, where some
18 parallel instances (from Cicero) are quoted, to which we may
add Quint. X 1, 105.
. 14 centum et viginti : Translate ‘Only 120 years.' The omis-
sion of ‘tantum,' almost invariably before numerals, is highly
idiomatic. Op. the exhaustive discussion by H. S. Anton, Stud. z.
lat. Gramm. I p. 126-161 (esp. Ρ. 134-136).

15 effici ratio temporum collegerit: i. e. ‘ Aper⁷s chronological
calculation (c. 17 15) has shown that we arrive at an interval of
only 120 years between Cicero's death and the present time.' The
somewhat strained expression was occasioned primarily by the
quasi-personification of ratio, on which see F. Meyer, De personifi
. . . usu Tacit. Gottingen 1884. Helmreich, Blaett. f. Bayr. Gymn.
X (1874) Ρ. 256 aptly quotes Colum. ΠΙ 10, 3 modo enim dispu-
tatio nostra colligebat unicuique corporis parti proprium esse adtri-
butum officium.

The MS. reading, therefore, does not present insuperable difficulties.
The deletion of ‘effici ' or of ⁴ collegerit,' on the other hand, is unmethodical,
because it is not probable that a scribe would ever have inserted either of
these verbs on mere caprice.

25. 1 tum: On the ellipsis of ‘inquit,' see note c. 4 1.
2 diu=pluribus verbis. So also c. 11 3.

3 ut opinor: On the meaning of ‘ut opinor’ see note c. 32 27.—
nominis controversiam: Cf. Cic. dehorat. I 11, 47. 23, 107 de fin.
