precisely what the critics up to the time 01 Woelfflin, barring a few
vague guesses, were incapable of furnishing.

It is necessary 'to bear this state 01 affairs well in mind, 11 we

friend,8 created. ,The letter in question (IX 10) is addressed to
Tacitus and reads as follows: Cupio praeceptis tuis parere, sed
aprorum tanta penuria 6813, ut Minervae et Dianae, quas ais pariter
colendas, convenire non possit. Itaque Minervae tantum servi-
endum est, delicate tamen ut in secessu et aestate. In via plane
nonnulla leviora statimque delenda ea garrulitate, qua sermones in
vehiculo seruntur, extendi. His quaedam addidi in villa, cum aliud
non liberet. Itaque poemata quiescunt, quae tu inter'NEMORA ET
Lucos commodissime perfici putas. Oratiunculam unam et alteram

que laboribus ruris quam voluptatibus„ simile. Vale. The words ‘tu
inter nemora et lucos commodissime perfici putas,' Lange insisted,
contain an unmistakable reference to c. 9 29 ff„ where Aper says:
adice quod poetis, 81 modo dignum aliquid elaborare et efficere
velint, relinquenda conversatio amicorum . . . atque ut ipsi dicunt,
in nemora et lucos, id est in solitudinem secedendum est and so
again in c. 12 1 1. nemora vero ct luci et secretum ipsum quod Aper
increpabat etc. This argument, taken in connection with the testi-
mony of the MSS. and a number 01 internal reasons which Lange
partly reiterated, partly adduced for the first time, appeared so
convincing that the long-standing controversy was generally re-
garded as having been permanently decided in favor 01 1116 great

⁸ The first announcement 01 this find was made by Spalding in a note to his
paper on Seneca’s Consolatio ad Polybium, published as early as 1803. But the
hope there expressed that the fortunate scholar would give publicity to his

discovery was not realised till 1814, when Lange's short treatise appeared in

Beck’s Acta Sem. et Soc. Philol. Lips. I 77-88. But, presumably owing to the
very limited circulation of this publication, the author's article attracted no
attention whatever, until Dronke reprinted it in his edition 01 1116 Dialogus in
1828 pp. XVI ff.
