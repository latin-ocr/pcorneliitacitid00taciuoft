phasised and convincingly demonstrated. But the most valuable
part of his treatise is the proof that chronological considerations
render a later date for the composition of the Dialogus than the
reign of Titus, altogether untenable. ‘¹ Tacitus 1ιαύ den Dialoq
nicht UNTER oder NACH, sondern voa Domitian yesclcrieben, oder
er hat ilm GAR Nlcn'r qeschriebeffl’ (p. 20).

The antagonists of the genuineness of the Dialogue having,
thanks to the labors of Weinkauff and Woelfflin, been completely
dislodged from their chief stronghold, shifted their operations and
now placed their main reliance upon chronological arguments
which, it was contended, proved a later date than that of Titus
and hence, according to the alternative formulated by Steiner him-
self, non-Tacitean authorship of the Dialogue. The foremost
spokesman of this party is Georq Andresen.

Most of these chronological objections were skilfully refuted by
Jansen (1878), 111 6116 of the ablest contributions to the controversy
ever made. Psychological and rhetorical reasons are here also
adduced to explain the stylistic change so conspicuous in the
admittedly genuine works of Tacitus.

Finally the entire question was again taken up by Weinkauff in
his ³ Untersuchungen zum Dialogus des Tacitus ⁹ (1881), but this
later work, though indispensable owing to the material accumulated,
does not mark any advance. It is marred by a deplorable diffuse-
ness and prolixity of treatment which obscures rather than
illustrates the issues involved and by an excessive zeal which but
too often tempts the author to find coincidences, where none exist.
