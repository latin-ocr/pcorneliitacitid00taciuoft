(³elegiacs or iambics’> is inapplicable to our passage, because
Maternus is spoken of only as a tragic poet.

2 insumere optat: Opto with inf. occurs in all periods. In Tac.
again H. IV 58 perire praeoptaverint. Cp. Dr. Η. S. II 307 f.
Schmalz, Latein. Synt. p. 480, Ueber den Sprachqebrauch, des Asin.
Pollio p. 88.——inde enim omnis fluxit oratio: Cf. Cic. Brut. 55,
201 a Cotta et Sulpicio haec omnis fluxit oratio—Enim is very
common in parenthesis. Cf. c. 8 2 11 3 24 7 and Lex. Tac.
p. 347 a b.

3 utilitates alunt: ‘advance our material interestS,' a ἇπ. εῖρ.,
but no bolder than e. g. H. IV 18 conatus . . . alunt and some of the
many metaphorica] applications of this verb cited in the lexica from
Cicero. Cf. also H. II 30 eandem utilitatem fovere. For the
abstract plural, cp. Dr. H. S. I 11 ff. and Proleg. p. ciii f.

4 brevem: The adjectives brevem, inanem and vagum, inanes,
volucre below are rendered more emphatic by being placed after
their nouns. Cp. Dr. Stil p. 91. Observe that Aper, in this nega-
tive part of his argument, retains the same subdivisions as outlined
in c. 5 15.

5 lieet: In a concessive clause only in the minor writings
c. 13 3 Ag. 32 licet . . . commodent, and once in a speech in the
Ann. XIV 55 licet multa videantur. Cp. in general, Hand, Tursell.
III 543-546. Schmalz, Antibarb. 3. v.

6 aures tuae respuant: Cic. Part. Orat. 5, 15 auditorum aures
respuant, pro Sull. 25, 70 cuius aures . . . respuerunt, pro Plano.
18, 44 respuerent aures . . . repudiarent. Quint. X1 1, 61 quid
aures hominum magis respuunt. Boetticher's assertion (Lex. Tac.
3. v.) that aures is more frequent in Τ. than in any other writer,
not excepting Cicero and Quintilian, is without foundation. It
occurs 47 times in Τ. to 41 in Quint. (smaller by about 40 pages),
and more than 50 times in Cicero's orations alone. ——After respuant,
we must supply some phrase like ³ dicam tamen? Cp. also the simi-
lar remark of Messalla c. 27 7 nec vos offendi decebit 31 quid forte
aures vestras perstringat. —- cui bono est: a legal formula of inquiry
touching the motive of the crime. The phrase was frequently used
and perhaps even invented by L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla (cons.
127 censor 125), celebrated for his severity as a judge (Val. Max.
III 7, 9 scopulus reorum). Cf. Cic. Rosc. Am. 30, 84. L. Cassius
ille quem populus Romanus verissimum et sapientissimum iudicem
