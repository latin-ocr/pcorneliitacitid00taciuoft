been the original, one is at a loss to understand the corruption in all our
MSS. It seems, therefore, more methodical to explain vel easdem as an
interlinear gloss which subsequently found its way into the text. The
remark was due to some ancient reader who not unjustly regarded the
arguments of the opponents of Aper as virtually identical, they being,
indeed, quite of the same mind as to the actuality of the decline of eloquence.
Cf. 16 12 nec aequo animo (sc. Aprum) perferre hanc nostram pro antiquo-
rum laude concordiam and 1. 14: non enim . . . saeculum nostrum patiar
hac vestra conspiratione damnari.

17 dum· · · redderent: Another similar instance of a dum-clause
subordinated to a clause with cum is found in Ann. XII 68 cum
obtegeretur dum reliqua . . . componuntur. The parallel examples
quoted by Hand, Tursell. ΙΙ 310 ff. from poets and late writers
are very doubtful, owing to the constant confusion of ‘cum' and
‘ dum’ in our MSS. (cf. Serv. ad Verg. Aen. Ι 697 ).—The irregular
use of the imperf. subj. must be explained by assimilation.—On
the syntactical use of “ dum' in general, see Dr. H. S. ΙΙ 609, and
the exhaustive discussion of E. Hoffmann, Latein. Zeitpart. p. 169 ff.
For ‘ dum ⁷ with indicat. in indirect discourse esp. common in Tac„
see note to 0. 32 33.—quisque‚ with a plural predicate is mostly
poetic and very rare in classical prose, the harshness of the con-
struction being often lessened by a plural antecedent. So singuli
here. Cf. Tac. H. ΙΙ 44 ΙΙΙ 33 IV 25 V 20 Ann. Ι 44 XII 43
XV 57. For examples in other writers, see R. V. ΙΙΙ 30 note
337 Dr. Η. S. Ι 170 ff. Stil p. 14 f.—On suus quisque, cp. the
‘exhaustive treatment of Wex, Agricola p. 321-328,—animi et
ingenii: A common collocation in Cic. (e. g. De orat. Ι 25, 113 ΙΙΙ
2, 5 Orat. 38, 132 Brut. 24, 93 ad fam. IV 8, 1). In Tac. only here
and again c. 21 39. Cf„ however, G. 29 mente animoque, H. Ι 84
quem nobis animum, quas mentes. The distinction is well brought
out by Quint. ΙΙ 4, 20 inqenium exercetur multiplici variaque
materia et animus contemplatione recti pravique formatur.

18 numeris · · - rationibus: ³Divisions, parts' . . ‘arguments’
The other meanings of numeri are less suitable to the context.
The passage is probably modelled upon Cic. de orat. ΙΙΙ 4, 16 nos
enim ipsi sermoni non interfuissemus et quibus C. Cotta tantum-
modo locos (= numeros) ac sententias (Ξ rationes) huius disputa-
tionis tradidisset. See Peter ad loc. Andresen interprets numeri
in the metaphorical sense of ‘munds' which it sometimes has in
Quint„ but in that case the clause servato . . . disputationis were
