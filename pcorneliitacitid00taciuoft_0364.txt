222 NOTES.

10 tristem: A rhetorical term synonymous with ¹ horriduS, rudiS,
incultus, severus, impolitus, hebes, sordidus, ieiunus,' opp. to ³ hila-
ris, laetUS, ornatuS‚ limatus, nitidus, comptus.⁷ Cf. Causeret p.
17 4 f. SandyS, Orat. 5, 20.—inpexani, synonymous with ³ incultus?
The word occurs in its ordinary meaning in poetry e. g. Verg. G.
III 366 Aen. VH 667 Hor. Sat. Π 3, 126 Tib. I 3, 69 Ov. Met. I
529 (2) The only other example in prose, significantly also in a
figurative sense, is in Tac. Ann. XVI 10 vidua inpexa luctu con-
tinuo, so Ritter, Halm, Nipp. and Furneaux3 others (e. g. Draeger)
retain the reading of the Med. in plexa (1. e. inplexa), but this is
not found elsewhere in Latin. Cp. the analogous use of ποκοειδής
in Περὶ ὕψους 15, 5 ἐνίοτε μέντοι ἀκατεργάστους καὶ οἱονεὶ ποκοειδεῖς τὰς
ἐννοίας καὶ ἀμαλάκτους φέροντος (Sc. Αἰσχύλου).

11 Ο.. Roscii: Q. Roscius Gallus was born near Lanuvium and
died shortly before the delivery of Cicero's speech pro Archia (62
B. c.). He was by common consent, the greatest comic actor whom
Rome produced, the intimate friend of Sulla, Hortensius and espe-
cially of CicerO, whose teacher he is said to have been (Plut. Cic. 5)
*and whose speech in his behalf (68 B. 0.) 18 still extant. His art,
the result of the most painstaking care and the profoundest study
(hence called ² doctus Roscius ' by Hor. Ep. II 1, 82) was deemed
so perfect that his name became proverbial for excellence in general
(Cic. de orat. Ι 28, 130 Brut. 84, 290 Festus p. 289 M..) Accord-
ing to Macrob. Sat. Π 10, he was the author of a work in which
the art of acting and of oratory was compared, and Diomed. G. L.
I 489, on the authority probably of VarrO, says that Roscius was
the first to introduce masks upon the Roman stage, an innovation
which Donatus, Praef. Ter. Eun. p. 10 R., however, dates as far
back as Ambivius Turpio. The studied refinement and dignity
which the Ciceronian period admired in Roscius and his great
contemporary, the tragedian AesopUS, appeared old-fashioned,
stilted and artificial in an age whose taste had been vitiated by the
realistic actiug of the pantomime. Cp. Friedlander II 445 f.
Aper’s criticism may possibly have been directly suggested by Cic.
de orat. Ι 59, 251 quis neget opus esse oratori in hoc oratorio
motu statuque Roscii gestum et venustatem.

12 Turpionis Ambivii: L. Ambivius Turpio, a celebrated theatri-
cal manager in the days of Terence and actor in most of his plays.
