and is found in the indelible impress made upon the mind of
Tacitus by the horrors of the reign of Domitian, for according to
Buffon's famous phrase, ⁰ 16 style est de l'homme 166166,” and 66
Goethe says ‘² Im Ganzen ist der Stil eines Schriftstellers 6111
116661 Abdruck seines Inneren.⁷' But if the man Tacitus neces-
sarily revealed himself in the stylist TacituS, it was as natural that
the buoyant optimism of his youth should revel in the exuberance
61 diction which characterises the Dialogue, as that a brief, suc-
cinct, nervouS, and energetic style should become 1116 fit vehicle of
expression for the feelings 61 1616666 indignation which had taken
possession of Tacitus when, after the death of Domitian, 116 deter-
mined to devote himself to historical composition.

Still another reason for the change under discussion is the differ-
ence 01 1116 subject—matter itself. A speech, a history, a dialogue or
a letter call for distinctly different stylistic treatment, at least in
the hands of an ancient writer, for Latin, as well as Greek, though
perhaps in an inferior degree, by reason 61 an incomparable flex-
ibility 61 structure and elasticity of form, can be made to reproduce,
like a 16661661 instrument, characteristic features 61 thought and
feeling. In fact, it is only in music that we can find a modern
analogue to this unrivaled versatility of expression of Greek and
Latin, modern languages being far more rigid, less plastic and more
devoid of stylistic freedom. Hence we find the various species of
literary composition in the classic tongues conforming to particular
types or genera dicendi peculiarly adapted to the thought which
they are designed to embody,1⁰6 and the numerous ancient systems
61 111616116, which to modern notions seem 66 often only the result

1661616, numerosum 61 aequabile dicendi genus, quo iuvenis viguerat, sicut con-
tinuis imbribus vexata et prostrata seges non ad priorem integrum laetumque
florem resurgit, cum praesertim uberes iarn et frequentes spicas conceperit.
Animo eius concusso, ex acerbato, indignato talis sermo non amplius conveni-

non potuisse videmus, quin in historicis suis scriptis componendis uteretur ἢ,

sermone a dialogi stilo prorsus alieno.

10⁶ It is this mechanical clement which alone explains the successful perpetra-
tion in antiquity 61 66611 literary frauds as that of Anaximenes’ Τρικάρανος or
the numerous apocrypha} writings of Lysias, Demosthenes, etc., no less than the
stylistic parodies of Plato. See Classical Studies in Honor of Henry Drisler
