to say ἁπάσαις πόλεσιν ἔστι τις ἐν Ῥώμῃ προστάτης. The reference
in our passage cannot, therefore, be to this custom, for Secundus is
speaking only of the honors which orators were wont to achieve,
and the well-known names of patroni, such as the Marcelli (Sicily),
Fabii (Allobroges), Fabricius (Samnites), which Peter cites, are not
known to us as orators. I am rather inclined to see, with Wolff
ad loc., an allusion to the words of Aper c. 3 18 cum te tot coloni-
arum . . . clientelae in forum vocent, where see note. Cf. also
c. 41 4.

19 f. hos ituri in provincias magistratus reverebantur, hos reversi
colebant i. e. in order to have influential orators to protect their
interests during their absence (cf. e. g. Cicero's speech pro leg.
Man.) and to secure their powcrful aid in case of accusations (e. g.
for extortion in the provinces), when they return. Maternus, in
opposition to SecunduS, deprecates the homage received by orators
under such conditions, not regarding it as anything to be proud of.
Cf. c. 41 3 ff. quis enim nos (sc. oratores) advocat nisi aut nocens
aut miser ἱ) quod municipium in clientelam nostram venit nisi quod
aut vicinus populus aut domestica discordia agitat? quam pro·
vinciam tuemur nisi spoliatam vexatamque.

20 f. hos - - · consulatus vocare ultro videbantur: The boldness of
this personification is somewhat lessened by the addition of ‘vide-
bantur' which has the force of ‘quasi.'—— Ultro ‘without effort on
their part,' see note c. 5 23. Cp. the saying ³ The office must seek
the man, not the man the office.'-This admiring comment, if at-
tributed to Maternus, would be irreconcilable with the low estimato
of such honors expressed in c. 13 3 licet illos certamina et pericula
sua vel ad consulatus evexerint.

21 f. hi ne privati quidem sine potestate erant: privatus as op-
posed to * magistratus.' Cf. Cic. de inv. Ι 25, 35 privatus an cum
potestate Tac. Ann. VI 2 (8) privatos an e magistratibus XV 21
olim quidem non modo. . . consul sed privati etiam mittebantur.
But in the imperial age, it often simply designated the ‘subject'
Cf. Tac. Ag. 39 privati hominis nomen supra principis attolli
Mayor to Iuv. XIII 41.—p0testas is here somewhat loosely, as
also elsewhere in Tacitus, used as a synonym of ‘potentia, vis)
Cp. notes c. 5 23 19 23 and Lex. Tac. s. v.—Cicero’s struggle with
Antony may furnish an instance in point.
