slight sels-contradiction of Tacitus, moreover, seems also to betray
an earlier source. The author makes Messalla say that the time-
honored custom by which a young man would attach himself to
some great orator, had gone out 01 vogue in his day (0. 34 init), and
yet Tacitus represents himself in the introduction as consor-ming to
this very practice l Now this discrepancy 18 31 01100 accounted 101
011 1110 supposition that Tacitus is here simply echoing the views
01 1118 ‘Quelle.⁷ But be this 38 11 may, deny, 11 you will, that
neither Chrysippus nor Varro was directly consulted, the fact 11131
1110 chapters on education are 1101 entirely original with Tacitus
must nevertheless, on the strength 01 the evidence accumulated
above, be regarded as indisputable.

We have seen that the author 01 1110 Dialogus is under the great-
est 01 obligations to previous writers, notably Cicero, but in spite
01 11118 we cannot but admit that Tacitus, even in his youth, was
no servile imitator, but that he assimilated his borrowed material
in such a manner as to make it practically his own,202 admirably
succeeding in producing a work, homogeneous in construction,
artistically elaborated in its style, and bearing all the outward
indications 01 311 original composition.x

Both Draeger and Gantrelle accord a very niggardly treatment to the Dialogus,
Weinkauff's second part is wholly inadequate, and Boetticher, Leae. Tac.. pp.
xxxix-cii is very incomplete and somewhat antiquated. The above synopsis
aims at no scientific arrangement, but is merely designed to give a tolerably
complete survey 01 the stylistic usage of the Dialogue‚ in a conveniently tab-
