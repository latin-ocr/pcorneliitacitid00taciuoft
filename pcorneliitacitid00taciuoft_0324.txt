p. 44.

25 31 referas· · ·videatur: The present subj. in both protasis
and apodosis is found in Tacitus only here 0. 26 2 and Ag. 46 and
Ann. III 54 31 velis . . . timeas.

26 naturam saeculorum: i. e. the astronomical duration of ‘sae-
cula,' which is further elucidated by the ‘ nam ' clause.

If we read ‘siderum' with Usener, the explanatory ‘nam' clause would
lack a proper antecedent, for ⁴ natura siderum ' cannot signify ⁴ movement
of the stars,' which is the only meaning permitted by the context.

respectum: For the pleonasm ‘referas . . ·. respectum⁷ cf. note
11 8. Respectus in the sense of ‘ in reference to' is a ³ vox Liviana!

Respectu, though an easy emendation and accepted by many editors,
violates the stylistic usage of the Dialogus, which does not admit the collo-
cation of 6 prepositional phrase and a simple case, unless as in c. 21 32 and
31 ext. a difference in meaning is involved. This peculiar inconcinnity‚
highly characteristic of Tacitean style, is practically confined to his larger
works. In the minor writings only Ag. 1. 19. 31 G. 2.7. 17. 29. 32. Cp.

27 aevi: Observe the variety of expressions for time: aetas,
tempus, 36601116, aevum. Cf. Quint. XI 1, 10 61) hominibus sui
temporis. . . ultimae senectutis aevum saeculorum.—in proximo:
Another slight inaccuracy, for ‘in proximo' must be taken with
‘Demosthenis aetatem‚' though it belongs grammatically to ‘spa-
tium' See note c. 15 14.

28 Cicero in Hortensio scribit etc: Servius ad Aen. I 269-111
284 6130 quotes the Hortensius for this identical piece of informa--
tion. Concerning the ‘magnus annus' often referred to by the
ancients from Plato downward (Tim. 39 D), see Madvig, Cic. de
fin. II 30, 102 Censorin. de d. n. 18,11 and Usener, Rhein. Mus.
XXVIII p. 390 ff. Plasberg 1. 0. p. 63 f.

29 06611 siderumque: Siderum is added to caeli as the more
specific term, in accordance with the usage pointed out c. 9 1. So
Ag. 12 111116 caelum ac sidera—cum maxime=v23v γε μάλιστα,
