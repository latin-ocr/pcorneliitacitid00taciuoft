22 111110 utrique superstites essent: Aper, in accordance with the
casuistical course of reasoning which characterises his argument
throughout, purposely uses this indefinite expression in order to
create the impression upon the casual listener, that the interval
between the deaths of Demosth. or Hyper. and Alexander was
much greater than it actually was. See also next note. On the
use of ‘utrique,' see note c. 2 6.

‘Huic‘ is an evident and easy emendation os Vahlen (Prooem. 1878-9
p. 12), for it is ridiculously sels-evident to say that Dem. and. Hyperides
survived not only Alexander but also Philip, who died 13 years before his
great successor.

23 11011 multo plures quam 000 annos: Aper intentionally reduces
the‘ actual number of years that had elapsed between the age of
the great Attic orators and his own time to as low a figure as a
liberal interpretation of ‘utrique . . . essent ' 011 the one hand and
‘nostram aetatem' on the other will allow, for by this sophistical
calculation he secures a chronological interval sufficiently small
for his present purpose.

Lipsius and his modern followers have either overlooked or ignored this
evident purpose of Aper, not to mention that, even if we date strictly from
the year 322 13. c. to 7 5 A. 1)., the sum total will be only 397, which is, of
course, incompatible with ⁴ non multo plures,’ etc. Cp. John, Fleck.

24 quod spatium . . . est: The entire passage is borrowed directly
from Cicero's dialogue Hortensius, as is clear from the following
passage in Iamblich. Protrept. c. 8, for Cicero and the late Greek
author are alike indebted to a common third source, namely
Aristotle's Προτρέπτικος; Τι’ δ’ ἐστὶ μακρὸν ἢ τί πολυχρόνιον τῶν
ἀνθρωπίνων ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἡμετέραν ἀσθένειαν οἶμαι καὶ βίου
βραχύτητα καὶ τοῦτο φαίνεται πολύ τι. See PrOC. Am. Phil.
