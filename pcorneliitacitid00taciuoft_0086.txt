lxxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

brought out in a negative way by his contention that the moderns .
did not enjoy the essential conditions which made the oratory of Α

the past what it was, The prerequisite element of a direct and
irreconcilable antagonism between the two eminent teachers of
Tacitus is therefore wholly a'nd significantly wanting, and hence
there existed no motive for including Secundus in the ³ criminatio,'
with which Maternus and Messalla on the one side, and Aper, their
equally fervent opponent, on the other, good-naturedly threaten

one another in parting.
Summing up the previous discussion, we conclude that, after

Messalla had finished, Secundus followed in a speech, and that he ’
111 turn was succeeded by MaternuS, who brings the entire debate Ξ

to a close. But the beginning and end of Secundus' speech, the
end of Messalla's, and the beginning of that of Maternus are lost

in the two lacunae (6. 35 ext. 40 7) which unfortunately disfigure' .

the closing portions of the treatise.

Of our MSS„ only the X class (A and B) seem at first sight to .Ξ

furnish a definite clue to the exact size of the gap, both stating ξ
that sim paycs were missing. But unfortunately the Dialogus takes -
up 16 pages in A and 29 in B, which proves that the words ‘sex -

pagellae’ were simply copied from their common source,¹⁶⁹ now lost,

so that we are still ignorant as to the actual dimensions of the
page in the original archetypon. Egger¹⁷⁰ maintained that nine
pages had been omitted, basing his calculation upon the worthless Ξ
cod. Parisiensis 7 7 73, but his premise is a pure fancy, and has justly ἶ
been rejected by Habbe1⁷1 (p. 8). His own attempt, however,
though ingenious, rests upon no firmer foundation, as he operates
with two undemonstrable assumptions. He tacitly takes it for u
granted ε (1) That the number six was found in the margin of the ’ἓ
cod. Hersfeldensis (2) That the codd. Med. 47, 36 and 68, 1, con·
