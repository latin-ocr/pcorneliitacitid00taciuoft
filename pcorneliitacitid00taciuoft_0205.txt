postero die: Far less common in Tac. than ‘postera die,’ although
the masc. gender of ‘dies' greatly predominates in other 6011066-
tions, but without any distinctions of meaning. Postera die
seems not to occur before the time of Livy. Cp. the exhaustive
discussion in Neue, Formenlehre, Ι, p. 681-88 and also R. V„ I.

60 Q. Catulus senex cum C. Iulio fratre venit. -Catonemz a fabula
praetexta dealing with the ‘ nobile letum' of Cato Uticensis. This
sturdy opponent of Caesar was extravagantly praised in the early
empire by poets and rhetoricians, being frequently made the mouth-
piece of republican sentiments. Cf. Manilius Ι 7 93 ff. Lucan Bk.
II and IX, and Seneca, to whom Cato represented the true Stoic
ideal of civic virtue. Cf. e. g. Ep. 24, 6 ff. 71, 15 ff. 95, 69 ff. 104,
29 ff. Dial. I 2, 9 ff. — Catonem i. e. the tragedy Cato and so below

2 offendisse potentium animos: 1. 6. probably the Emperor and
his all—powerful friends such as Crispus and Marcellus. Vespasian
was a humane ruler and not easily provoked to harsh and unjust

Helvidius Priscus and the expulsion of the Stoic and Cynic philoso-
phers (Cass. Dio 66, 13) were well calculated to arouse apprehensions
for the safety of the bold poet who so frankly gave public expres-
sion to his liberal convictions. The sentiments put into Cato⁷s
mouth cannot, however, as is generally supposed, have been directed
against monarchical institutions as such, but were doubtless levelled
against the political evils which had grown up under them, for Ma-
ternus in c. 41 in perfect accord with similar utterances in the
historical writings of Tacitus, (see Proleg. p. xxxvi), does not advo-
cate a return to a republican form of government but, for reasons of
expediency, sincerely acquiesces in the existing order of things, only
deprecating the despotic abuse of monarchical power. Cf. Nipper-
