Demosthene accepimuS, ea aetate L. Crassus ostendit id se in
1010 optume iam facere, quod etiam tum poterat domi cum laude
meditari. The defendant, C. Papirius Carbo (see 0. 18 3), 00111-
mitted suicide before sentence was pronounced upon him (Cic. ad
fam. IX 21, 3 Brut. 27, 103 V'al. Max. 111 7, 6).

33 uno et vicensimo Caesar Dolabellam: 01. Suet. Caes, 4 com-
posita seditione civili (i. e. M. Aemilio Lepido D. Iunio Bruto coss.
77 Β. 0. 01. 0. Ι. L. I p. 439 Brut. 92, 317 f.) Cornel. Dolabellam
consularem et triumphalem repetundarum postulavit. This speech
(mentioned also by Ascon. in Scaur. p. 26 Or. Vell. Pat. II 43 Plut.
Caes. 4) established Caesar's oratorical reputation. Cf. Suet. Caes.

The MSS. all have nono decimo . . . L. Crassus etc.‚ which date, as
Lambinus and Brotier pointed out, conflicts with the express testimony
01 Cic. l. 0. Nipperdey, Rhcin. Mus. XIX 577 ff. (= Opusc. 323 11), has,
therefore, substituted uno et vicensimo. That the trial 01 Carbo (see also
note 0. 18 3) took place after his consulship in 120 B. 0. (0. Ι. L. I p. 534) is
clear from a comparison of Cic. de leg. 111 16, 35 and de orat. II 40, 170,
and as Crassus (see Cic. Brut. 43, 1431) was born in 140 Β. 0., 11 follows that
he was not nineteen but twenty-one years 01 age in 119 B. 0. -In the second
date the MSS. are again at variance with the facts, as Casaubonus and
Lipsius observed, for according to the unimpeachable testimony of Sueto-
nius 1. 0., Caesar (born July 13, 100; see Violet p. 169) must have been at
least 23, 1101 21 years old, when he accused Dolabella. There can, there-
1010, be no doubt that the dates given in our MSS. involve two chrono-
logical errors, but the propriety or justification 01 emending the text ac-

- cordingly, must be very seriously questioned, 101 apart from the intrinsic
improbability 01 two palpable errors in the MSS, the corrections proposed
destroy the chronological sequence (19-21-22-24) evidently designed by
the author. Under these circumstances, we are forced to the conclusion
that the dates here given are due to Tacitus or rather to the source which
he consulted. This is rendered the more plausible, as the chronological
data concerning the speeches 01 famous orators seem to have been 01 0
particularly conflictiny character, as we must 111101 110111 an interesting pas-
sage in Gell. N. A. XV 28, 011 which see Proleg. p. xcvii where some reasons
are also advanced 101 believing that Tacitus is directly indebted 101 the
erroneous information in question to Mucianus.

altero et vicensimo Asinius Pollio C. Catonem: C. Porcius Cato,
a relative 01 0010 Uticensis, was tribunus plebis in 56 and accused
by Pollio (born 76 Β. 0.) 101 maladininistration. He was defended
by Calvus and M. Scaurus and acquitted, July 3, 54 Β. 0, Cf. Cic.
