y* the reign 'of Titus. Happily it can also be proved (1) that it must

have been composed at that time and (2) that a later date, while
j· quite incompatible with Tacitean authorship, is at the same time
>- irreconcilable with the authorship of any one else, so that we are

put to the alternative of attributing the Dialogue to the writer to
whom the MSS. ascribe it (the biographical data of Tacitus inter-
posing no obstacle to this assumption), or of unwarrantably suppos-
ing that some totally unknown author wrote the treatise between
7 9-81 !

In the first place, Ι fully agree with Andresen and others that
the view which brings the Dialogus within close temporal proximity
to the Agricola and Germania involves a psychological impossibility
(see also note 28).

A second obstacle in the way of a later date was first pointed out,
Ι believe, by Steiner (p. 17 f.). In the introductory chapter, the
author tells us that he intends to reproduce from memory ‘isdem
numeris isdemque rationibus, servato ordine disputationis‚' a debate
which he had heard as a very young man. Now on the theory that
these words were written six or seven years after the event
referred to, the statement, though taxing our credulity to some
extent, nevertheless remains within the bounds of possibility. At
any rate, it does not go beyond the wide latitude which the
traditional usage of dialogue writers from Plato to Cicero has
sanctioned. In fact, the prooemium of the Dialogus is unmistak-
ably modelled upon a similar dramatic device of Cicero.³⁹ Plato, it
is true, makes most extraordinary demands upon the memory of his
Socrates, but he is very careful to confine the interval between the
discussion and its subsequent detailed report to very narrow limits.
In view of these facts, it may be safely denied that a writer, who
shows himself so admirably successful in imparting to a fictitious
debate the semblance of historical 'reality, would deliberately, at the
very outset, disillusionise his readers by calmly asserting that he
was simply retelling from memory, with all accuracy and minute-
ness of detail, a conversation which he· had listened to more than
—twenty years previous! Such self-stultification on the part of
our author is incredible, and yet we should be forced to believe
in it, if our treatise was not written till after the death of
Domitian.
