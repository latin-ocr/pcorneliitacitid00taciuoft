vocant, as in c. 35 2 qui rhetores vocantur Cic. de orat. 1 12, 52
permulta sunt quae ipsi magistri, qui rhetorici vocantur, nec trae-
dunt nec tenent ΠΙ 14, 54 qui se horum, qui nunc ita appellantur,
rhetorum (misquoted by Peter). The phrase here implies the
charge that these corrupters of youth unjustly arrogated a Greek
name to themselves, which always designated a highly respectable
calling. Possibly the Greek accusative plural was used for
the express purpose of calling attention to this fact, for rhetoras
occurs only here, c. 35 13 and in the very Senatus consultum (cited
c. 35 5) referred to in both of the Dialogus passages. On the very
rare use of Greek endings in Tacitus, see note c. 31 34.

5 professio=disciplina In this sense, the word is post-Aug.
Cf. Vell. Pat. Ι 16, 2 eminentissima cuiusque professionis ingenia.
Suet. de gramm. 4 iam discretis professionibus Quint. Prooem. 4.
Ι 4, 1. 8,15. 9, 1 II 1, 4. —quando primum etc: See note c. 35 2.

⁶ De curiis' seems to be the remnant of a marginal gloss (see p. 38) which,
on becoming incorporated into the text, caused the corruption now exist-
ing. If so, the numerous emendations proposed cannot be seriously con-
sidered as even plausible restorations of the archetypon. But quite apart
from this, most of these conjectures, on their authors' own admission, can
only refer to a statement of Messalla in a Subsequent speech, which he at
this stage of the discussion clearly had no intention of delivering. See the
closing words of c. 32. Andresen, wishing to avoid this objection‚ contende
that the promise implied in ‘statim dicturus' is actually fulfilled at once,
· the unpopularity of rhetorical schools being made manifest by the following
account of the course of training which the ancient orators‚ or rather Cicero
as their representative, underwent. But this interpretation, besides involv-
ing a petitio principii, does not call for a phrase like ⁴ statim dicturus‚' by
the side of referam necesse est. Michaelis'‚ Peter's and Nipperdey’s
emendations are palaeographically quite impossible. Nor is Vahlen’s
⁴ decursurus’ (Prooem. Berol. 1881 p. 11 f.) convincing.

9 infinitus labor et· - · meditatio: Cf. Tac. Ann. IV 61 oratorum
meditatio et labor Cic. de orat. I 1, 1 infinitus forensium rerum
labor. On the ³ oratio trimembris‚² amplified as usual in the third
member, 866 Proleg. pp. cv ff.

10 ipsorum· · · continentur libris: The speaker means to say,

” that the evidence of this wide and thorough culture is abundantly

manifest in their published orations, (On liber = oratio, see note c.
3 2), an interpretation confirmed by ³ itaque hercule in libris Cicero-
nis deprehendere licet non geometriae etc.⁷ below. John under-
stands ³ continentur in libris’ of actual memoirs published by the
