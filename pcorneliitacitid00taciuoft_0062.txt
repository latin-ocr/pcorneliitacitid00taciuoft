Quintilian.

lx PROLEGOMENA.

to multiply objections ¹¹⁶ against the hypothesis under discussion,
it may be said that it bears as much resemblance to the diction of
the Dialogus as it does to that of his teacher, Quintilian. Of the
many so-called parallelisms collected by N ast, HeSS, Eckstein and
Vogel, by far the greater number, it must also be observed, belong to
the common vocabulary of the language ; others more particularly
exhibit the features of post-Augustan usage and the stereotype

character of what may be called the rhetorical vernacular of the ,

schools of the day. More important is the fact, that amid so much
of unavoidable similarity, the diction of Pliny on closer inspection
displays, when compared with the style of the Dialogue, so many
inherent divergencies, as to render identity of authorship quite
impossible.¹¹⁷

The arguments advanced in favor of Quintilian ¹²⁸ are substan-
tially based upon the same observations and considerations as some
of those just mentioned. They are, however, more numerous, more
subtle and, as the non-Tacitean authorship of the Dialogue is ex
hypothesi complacently regarded as indisputable, not without some
shadow of probability.

Lipsius and his followers were, it seems, primarily lured into
boldly declaring in favor of the great rhetorician, not so much by
stylistic considerations as by the fact that Quintilian himself
repeated1y11⁹ refers to a treatise, published but a few years before
the Institutio, entitled de causis corruptae eloquentiae, for this
title appeared to Lipsius, as we have seen, to harmonise so per-
fectly with the subject discussed in the extant Dialogue that he
had no scruples in identifying it with the lost treatise of Quintilian.
It is psychologically interesting, in this connection, to observe how
completely a preconceived opinion was able to blind even so great
a critic as Lipsius to the palpable fact that the very quotations
from the ³ de causis corruptae eloquentiae ' are not only not found

11⁶ See esp. Eckstein l. c. I am not disposed to attach too much weight to
the obJ'ection‚ based upon Pliny's omission of any reference to Messalla or
MaternuS, for these were doubtless long dead when the earliest extant letter was
written (97 A.D.), and it is doubtful if the alleged poetic reputation of Maternus,
alluded to only in the Dialogus, long survived him.
