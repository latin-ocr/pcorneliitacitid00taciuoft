210 NOTES.

Senatus consurrexit et prosequebatur Catonem in carcerem. Hac
invidia facta, Caesar destitit et mitti Catonem iussit! The first
attempt at ¹ closure ² with a view to checking this abuse was made
by the lex Pompeia de vi et ambitu (52 B. o.), mentioned c. 38 6,
where see note. Cp. Mommsen, Rem. Staatsr. III 919. 934. 985
Lange, Rem. Alter-tlt. II 384. 452. -By these long-winded speeches
we can strictly, it would seem, understand only those delivered in
the ‘ comitia,’ for, if we include the senate, ‘pop ut imperitus’ is out
of place, if the law courts, ‘ diem dicendo eximere' is inapplicable,
because the time allotted to speakers in a judicial trial was appar-
ently limited by the clepsydra, at least as far back as 70 B. e. (Cic.
Verr. I 9, 25 legitimae horae). Cp. Marquardt, Privatleb. 370 ff.
Smith, Dior. Ant. I 775. On the other hand, it is not probable that
Aper's remark should, for no apparent reason, have been inten-
tionally confined to the orators in the comitia. We must, therefore,
add this passage to the examples of inconsistency enumerated in
c. 3 20.-—Eoeimeret and videretur (below) in the protasis, the apo-
dosis being usually in the imperf. indicative, are subjunctives of
¹indefinite frequency. This construction is extremely rare in pre-
Aug. prose. In Cicero only de orat. I 54, 232 erat enim Athenis
reo damnatO, si fraus capitalis non esset, quasi poenae aestimatiO,
but here Sorof, followed by Wilkins, ‘assume an oratio obliqua.
There is an indisputable instance, however, in Caes. B. G. V 35
sin . . . tenere vellent . . . relinquebatur, and Livy furnishes a
number of examples. In Silver Latin, finally, this so-called itera-
tive subj. is most frequent in Suetonius and quite common in Taci-
tuS. Cf. H. Ι 49 Π 5 IV 1 Ann. II 57 III 69 IV 7. 46 V 11 VI '
30 XV 45. Cp. Dr. H. S. II 733 Stil p. 77 f. (who omits our pas-
sage), Hoffmann, Zeitpartikelnl p. 52 ff. —long'a principiorum prae-
paratio: praeparatio, προπαρασκευή, is a technical term referring to
the attempts of an orator to render his hearers or the judge favor-
ably disposed toward him at the outset. Cf. Quint. IV 1, 1 (cited
below) 723 2, 26. Aper does not condemn this practice, and it
is expressly recommended by Quint. (cf. IV 2 VII 10, 12 IX 2, 17
etc), but he objects to what seem to him excessively long intro-
ductions of this kind, tolerated by the audiences of the Republic.
Cf. Quint. IV 1, 62 nec minus evitanda est immodica eius (prin-
cipii) lonqitudo ne in caput excrevisse videatur et quo praeparare
debet, fatiget. —Lonqa for ‘longorum' by hypallage. Cf. note c. 2 3.
