35 non multum aetate antecedens Calvus Vatinium: According
to Quint. XII 6, 1 Calvus, who waso-born in 821³. c., began his
oratorical career some time before he had reached the quaestorian
age (i. e. the 27th year). The present allusion must, therefore, be
understood of the first accusation of Vatinius in 58, when Calvus
was 24 years old, which perfectly agrees with the statement ‘non
multum aetate antecedens' (sc. Crassum Caesarem Pollionem).
This indisputable inference, as well as ‘hodieque Zeqimus,'
below, admirably confirms the conjecture tha-t this first speech
against Vatinius, though never actually delivered, was subsequently
put in writing. See note c. 21 10. —With the phrase ‘non multum
etc.,⁷ cf. Cic. Brut. 21, 82 aetate paullum his antecedens Quint. X
1, 103 paulum aetate praecedens eum. —Observe the studied sym-
metry in the collocation of the proper names, the praenomen being
added in the first and third groups and omitted in the second and
fourth. In the historical works of Tac. a different principle ob-
tains, for of the names here mentioned all, with the exception of
C. Cato and Dolabella, had already been introduced to the reader.
Cp. note c. 18 17. —insecuti‚ in its technical sense ‘to prosecute,’

Gk. διώκειν.

‘iis ' and ‘ his' (EV) are habitually confounded in our MSS„ 'so that the
context is the only guide to follow. In the present instance, his, which
John alone of commentators advocates, is, in my judgment‚ though syntac-
tically perfectly admissible, utterly out of place, for his orationibus could
only signify ‘the orations still extant,' a very superfluous remark in view
of the following clause, and John himself translates, as if the reading were
‘ illis.' Cp. also c. 39 ext. itaque hercule eiusmodi libri extant etc., where
John, if consistent, ought also to have changed ‘eius modi’ into ‘ huius

modi.'

hodieque ³ still, to-day' in the sense of ‘hodie' or ‘hodie quoque'
‘noch heutzutage' first occurs in Vell. Pat. e. g. Ι 4, 2 and there--
after frequently in Silver Latin, particularly in the Elder Pliny,
Seneca and Suetonius. Cp. Dr. H. S. Π 46 Woelfflin, Phicol. XXVI
160 Peterson, Quint. X 1, 95 and esp. the excellent article in
Schmalz, Antih. I p. 597. In Tacitus again: G. 3 quod in ripa
Rheni situm hodieque incolitur, where ‘hodieque' is taken by
some less correctly, it would seem, in the sense of ‘et hodie'

‘und bis auf den heutigen Tag.'
