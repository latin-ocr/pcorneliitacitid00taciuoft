bant II 5. 84 III 8. Besides the historical compilations here
cited, he was the author 01 another work (Travels in Syria ?), from
which Pliny (and perhaps Josephus) has preserved some very
untrustworthy information. Cf. Teuffel ξ 314, 1 and L. Brunn, de
C. Lio. Ilffuc. Leipz. 1870.

8 ut opinor does not express any genuine doubt as to the actual
number of books already published, but simply serves to avoid an
air of learning in what purports to be an i'nformal conversation
between friends, Cp. note 0. 32 27.-—Actorum libris: ‘Acta‚’ as
the context shows, must not be taken in its technical sense of
Acta populi, or acta senatus, publica, diurna, urbana ὑπομνήματα,

Suppl. III 5 pp. 558-632, but as a general title, virtually equiva-
lent to ‘Actiones' (01. c. 17 22 32 11). Τ110 work of Mucianus
probably contained an epitomised selection 01 the more noteworthy
speeches delivered in the assembly, the senate, the 10111111 and the
law-courts, with sundry biographical and chronological notes of
interest, and it has been plausibly conjectured that many 01 the
oratorical fragments preserved in Gellius, Fronto and Macrobius
were taken from this identical compilation. To the same source, Ι
3111 disposed to attribute the information given in c. 34 ext. and the
learned item in c. 38 15 1. where see notes and cp. also Proleg. p.
xcvi—tribus Epistularum: These were probably miscellaneous ex-

, cerpts similar to the ‘ Electa' in 160 bks. made by the elder Pliny

(Plin. Ep. ΙΙΙ 5, 17). Cf. also Fronto, Ep. ad Antonin. 2, 5 (p.
107 N.) memini me excerpisse ex Ciceronis epistulis ea dumtaxat,
quibus inesset aliqua de eloquentia vel philosophia vel de re publica
