in the Dialogue, but could not, from their very nature, have ever
occurred in it, as they deal with the faults of ‘³ elocutio ⁷⁷ proper,
such as the κακόζηλον, hyperbole and the like.1²⁰ But if 80, we are
put upon the horns of a dilemma, of which it would be hard to say
which is the more absurd. For either Quintilian wrote a book ‘ de
causis corruptae eloquentiae ' aad the Dialogus de oratoribus, but
by some strange accident repeatedly referred to the former only, or
else the two are identioal, the author's citations being by an equally
strange accident absent from the extant treatise ¹²1—which had no
place for them anywhere Σ

The remaining arguments adduced in favor of Quintilian pertain
to the matter and the form of the Dialogue, the treatise revealing,
it is contended, so many elements in common with the Institutio
Oratoria as to establish identity of authorship beyond question.

Now as regards the contents of the two workS, there can be no
possible doubt, as we may at once admit, that many and even
striking points of resemblance exist, andthey have been duly noted
in the Gommentary,122 but this fact can in no sense justify the
inference that has been drawn, for the following reasons ε “

(1) Similarity of subject matter neeessarily leads to similarity in
its presentation.

(2) Very many of the coincidences collected by the writers
mentioned are not peculiar to Quintilian, but may be readily paral-
leled from other authors, notably Cicero, to whom both Quintilian
and Tacitus are alike largely indebted. This is equally true of the
numerous aesthetic criticisms of literary men, upon which undue
stress has been laid, for here, if anywhere, the great rhetorician is
almost wholly dependent upon earlier sources, not only in Greek,
but to some extent even in Latin literature, where we certainly
might have expected greater independence and originality.128 These
judgments had in course of time become stereotyped and common
property, so to speak.

discussion of A. Reuter‚ De Quintiliani libro qui fuit de causis corruptae eloquen-
tiae, Diss. Breslau 1887 pp. 1-42.

1²¹ It is amusing to find some early advocates of the Quintilian theory getting
over this difficulty by supposing that the passages in question may possibly all
have been miraculously accumulated in the lacuna after c. 35 l
