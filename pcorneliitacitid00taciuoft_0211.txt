careful training. This criticism the author believes to be unjust (maligne)
and he proceeds to refute it by telling us that Aper only affected to conceal
these accomplishmentS, which he possessed in a very high degree, because of
his conviction that natural gifts elicit a higher admiration than achieve-
ments won by dint of laborious study. Most commentators take industriae
et laboris as an objective genitive, thus destroying what seems, in my
J‘udgment, the only psychologically admissible interpretation of Aper's atti-
tude. I have, therefore, had no hesitation in adopting Vahlen’s easy
emendation. It were still simpler to take ind. et lab. as genit. of com-
parison, but this Grecism is very rare in Tacitus, e. g. Ann. IV 63 cui
minor quadringentorum milium res (cp. Woelfflin, Der yenet. comparat. in
Archiv VII 119) and it may be doubted whether the construction is permis-
‚sible in the earliest period of the historian’s style. See Vahlen, Hermes 28, 358.

16 habiturus: A future participle in place of an entire clause,
first found in Livy (Kuhnast Liv. Synt. 267), is quite Tacitean and
particularly frequent with tamquam, quasi e. g. H. Ι 48 Ann. XII

49 ΧΙΙΙ 43. Cp. Dr. Stil ξ 215. Here it is perhaps preferable
to assume the omission of the subj. esset, an ellipsis also very

. common in Tac„ especially if a corresponding subj. follows which

prevents any possible ambiguity, e. g., Ag. 24 idque . . . profutu-
rum, si . . . tolleretur. Cf. Dr. Stil p. 17- f. VVetzell l. c. p. 50 ff.,
R. V. III p. 830 note 609, Heraeus, ad Hist. I 21 and Nipperdey
ad. Ann. I 7.

Ch. 3-4. Maternus, so far from yieldinq to the proposal of
Secundus to omit in tlte publication of his traqedy those passayes
which liad recently yiven offence, states his determination to remain
true to his convictions, and informs liis friends that he is already
preparinq another traqedy in ‚which similar utterances will be found.
Aper deplores tlie precious time wliicli tlze poet in his opinion is
thus wastinq upon undiqnified subjects and unprofltable pursuitsy
while liis oratorical talents are in such demand. Maternus, however,
more tlian ever resolved to abandon the irlcsome duties of tlie forum
for tlie companionsliip of the ilfuses, suqqests a renewed discussion
of a question often debated between him and his friend, reqardiny
the alleqed superiority of eloquence over poetry.

3. 1 igitur: Quint. I 5, 39 an sit ‘igitur' initio sermonis
positum dubitari potest, quia maximos auctores in diversa fuisse
opinione videO, cum apud alios sit etiam frequens (e. g. Cicero,

Sallust, Quint. himself) apud alios numquam reperiatur (e. g.
Caesar, the two Senecas). Cf. Woelfflin, Archiv III 560 f., Neue,
