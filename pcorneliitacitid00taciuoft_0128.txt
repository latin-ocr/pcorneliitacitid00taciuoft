to the false solution of compendia, to scriptura continua and other
errors familiar to the palaeographist. In about 17 passages (c. 7 1
10 28 13 26 14 14.18 15 7 16 11. 33 17 21 19 2.17 21 36 23 10 26 30
31 13 34 8), we must recognise the conjectural labors of Fontanus or
the copyist of the LeidensiS,⁴ which have in a number of instances
resulted in the restoration of the genuine reading. In still other
caseS, B, as we shall see, has been corrected from one or more
other MSS. Eliminating all these readings, we shall find but a
few variants in which B may with some degree of confidence be
said to have rescued the original reading of the archetype (c. 7 12
and possibly 25 21 26 30 36 11).

3. The Vaticanus 1518 (D)214' 1s a codex miscellaneuS, containing
a Life of Horace, Porphyrio's 21⁵ commentary, the Suetonius, Dialo-
9us (fol. p. 173 b—189 a), and Germania.²1⁶

The MS. was written by an unlearned scribe, who contented
himself with a mechanical transcription, being quite unmindful of
the sense of his text. It is just this feature which constitutes its
value, for his apographon thus became a faithful copy of the
original 3 but the archetypon must have abounded in abbreviations,
which caused this copyist repeatedly to go astray. For among
about 130 variants peculiar to D, over one third can be directly
traced to compendia. In many instances the scribe made no
attempt at decipherment, e. g. 10 26 vo (= voco) 194 i (= ista,
illa) c. 20 2 fante (perhaPS, as Andresen thinks, for ‘fabulantem‚'
the other MSS. reading ‘ praefantem ⁷), 28 12 ὂ (= circa), 31 9 §Hi
(= plerumque) 19 huit (= habuerit), 33 4 drafnfj (= differentiam-—
que), 19 {t (-= potest), 23 id (= istud, illud), 36 20 mratus (= ma-
gistratus), 36 b (= contra) etc.

In 46 instances (c. 3 18 5 11 19 25 25 30 26 2 30 23 31 2. 5 32 33

2¹5 As D, or rather its original, very frequently, as will be shown below,
agrees with the X class of MSS„ upon which archetypon Pontanus’ copy was
based, and as Henoch of Asc-oli is known to have discovered the Porphyrio,
Pontanus' statement, reproduced in B, regarding this monk's connection with
the Tacitean treatises, may simply be due to an inference on his part, readily
occasioned, if his copy also contained the Porphyrio together with the Dialogus
and the Germania.

21⁶ Massmann p. 16 by an unaccountable error says that this MS. has the
marginal note to c. 35 ‘hic desunt sex pagelle.' Michaelis only notes a vacant
space of ‘aliquot versus,' or 121} lines according to Andresen.
