ances were‘ openly recognised, while those deserving of censure
were not intentionally disavowed. The ellipsis of an affirmative
expression to be supplied from a negative, a species of zeugma, is
characteristic of Tacitus. E. g. H. I 8 Rufus vir facundus et pacis
artibus (sc. expertus), belli inexpertus Ann. I 55 ipsi tempus fore
quo crimina et innoxios (sc. ab noxiis) discerneret XII 64 Agrip-
pina quae filio dare imperium (sc. quibat, poterat), tolerare imperi-
tantem nequibat XIII 56 deesse nobis terra ubi vivamus (sc.
potest), in quo moriamur non potest. On this usage in other
writers, see SeyffeM'ull. Lael. 16, 59 (p. 387 f.) Madvig, de fin. II
8, 25 Kiihner II 1043 f. This interpretation gives an unobjection-
able sense, it is in conformity with Tacitean usage and calls for no
alterations in the text.

23 duraturam: On fut. act. part. = adj. see note c. 9 22.

24 in diversis subselliis ³ on the benches of the opposition!
Diversus-:adversus is quite common in Tacitus. Cf. Lex. Tac.
s. v. p. 305. So also Quint. XI 3, 133 diversa subsellia but 132
adversis subselliis. With the thought, cf. c. 37 ext—inde quin
immo: For this anastrophe seemote c. 6 7.

The repetition of the preposition in a comparative clause after ⁴ quam ’ is
the rule in Tacitus (e. g. c. 20 11 Ag. 5. 32 Η. II 44. 54. 76. 77 Ann. ΙΙΙ 12.
55 XV 6) and so generally in Latin prose. Exceptions are very rare. E. g.
Liv. III 19, 4 non in plebe coercenda quam senatu castigando vehementior
fuit. Cp. Hand, Tursell. III 409 f. Kiihner II 422. Haase’s statement in
R. V. III 731 note 576 that the ellipsis of ‘in' after ‘quam clauses ' is con-
fined to a few instances in poetry is, therefore, substantially true, for the
‘m ’ of quam easily caused the omission of the preposition in here as per-
haps also in the few exx. cited as exceptions.

‘25 fidelius: ‘ More strongly, lastingly.' Fidelis in Tac. only here
and Ann. XV 67, and both times in the comparative. Otherwise

‘fidus, fidissimus⁷ is used, and twice (Ann. I 57 XII 13) ‘magis
fidus! In the same sense also in Quint. Ι 4, 5 nisi oratoris futuri
fundamenta fideliter iecerit VI 4, 14 quod fideliter firmum est.

As Messalla began with a recapitulation of his first speech (qui foro . . .
studiis) so here in like manner, before passing on to another topic, he gives
a brief summary of his arguments, retaining, it will be observed, their exact
sequence (oratorum. . . experimentis). So again in c. 35 7 (locus . . . ad-
ferat) and in c. 5 19 (vel ad utilitatem etc.) the mode of treatment is care-
fully outlined by way of preface. This evident design on the part os tlte

author will suffice to refute the conjectures of Classen and Baehrens
(see p. 45).
