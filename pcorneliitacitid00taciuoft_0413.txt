24 sustinuit: ‘could not bring himself, did not venture,' like the
Homeric τλῆναι. The construction with the infinit. occurs first in
Ovid, e. g. Her. V 30 Met. VI 367 and in prose in Sen. Contr. I
praef. 24 Vell. II 86, 2, thereafter very common. In Tac. only
here and H. I 37 nec privatum me vocare sustineo. Both of these
examples are omitted by Dr. H. S. II 334.—in0usat0 Asinio et
Caelio et Calvo: The participle agreeing in the sing. with the
nearest proper name. Cp. note c. 26 18 and Andresen, Append. to
Nipp. Ann. Vol. II 319 f.

27 alium Ciceroni, alium Caesari: There is unquestionably a
slight incongruity, as Vahlen, Prooem. 1878s9 p. 5 has observed,
in the unexpected substitution of two new names in place of those
just enumerated, but Messalla means to point out that Aper, if he
desired to show the superiority of modern eloquence by means of a
comparison, ought not to have directed the brunt of his attack
against the three first-named orators, but should rather have singled
out the admittedly greatest oratorical representatives of that
period, namely Cicero and Caesar, pitting‘them severally against
the most eloquent men of the present. See Andresen⁷s note ad loc.

Spengel's proposal to insert ‘alium Brutum’ does not remove, but in-
creases the inconcinnity, and at the same time prevents its plausible expla-
nation.

deinde, practically equivalent to deinceps. So H. I 51 Sequanis
Aeduisque ac deinde, prout opulentia civitatibus erat, infensi.

But ‘ deinceps ’ may have been the original reading, 'the two words being
easily confounded, owing to similar abbreviation. Cp. c. 9 5 deinceps—

A B deinde—w.

nunc: ‘instead3 now, however,' a very common use of the word
in Tacitus. Cp. Lex. Tac. p. 985.

28 contentus, with inf. cf. note c. 18 13.

29 in publicum: ² In a general way,' synonymous with ² in uni-
versum' (G 6) and ‘in commune.² In Tac. only here and Ann.
XIII 56, also once in Quint. X 7, 1. The adj. ‘publicus’ is
frequently used in the same sense in Silver Latin, e. g. Seu.
Ep. 88, 12 publicum est quod tenes, quod tuum dicis 59, 1 p. verba.
In Cicero only in the ordinary meaning, e. g. de leg. agr. II 5, 13
lex in p. proponitur. ——in commune: Of very frequent occurrence,
particularly in Seneca and in Tacitus. Cf. Lex. Tac. s. v. ——Plin.
N. H. VI 17, 19, 50 similarly combines ‘in universum⁷ and ‘in
