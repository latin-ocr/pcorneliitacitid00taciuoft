Ch. 40 8-42. Maternus, in olosinq the discussion, endeavors to
reconoile the oppos-inq parties, represented by Aper on the one hand
and by Messalla and Secundus on the other. He freely admits that
the peouliar eonditions of the Roman Republic were hithy conducive
to the rise of eloquenoe‚ but he reminds his hearers that such orator-
ical eoeeellence was after all acquired at the expense of political
stability and tranquillity. Eloquence, as history attests, has never
thr-iven in law-abidinq and peaceful communities ,· it is the offsprinq
‘of license and would be as useless in a state where all was peace and
virtue, as a physieian amonq a people free from disease. Recall the
past we cannot, nor were this a consummation to be wished ; it
therefore becomes the duty of all to rest content with the qood which
one's own time undoubtedly offers, and to refrain from belittlinq that
of some other epoeh.

On the necessity of assuming a lacuna after 1. 8, see Proleg.
pp. lxxv—lxxx.

8 non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur: An unmistakable allusion
to the words of Secundus in c. 36 4 1-“. composita et quieta et beata
republica, where see note. Cf. also c. 37 30 nos de ea re loqui quae
facilius turbidis et inquietis temporibus existit.

Although the organic connection with the preceding has been lost in the
lacuna, the parallel passages just cited and the antithesis in ‘alumna
licentiae ' render it all but certain that Tacitus wrote ‘ re publica ' here or
understood ‘ res ' in that sense (see Dict. and note c. 21 21.) i. e. Eloquence
is not the offspring of a ‘bene constituta civitas‚' but of anarchy.—
‘Gaudere' of abstract or inanimate things, though not rare (see note
below), is also far less bold, when said of ‘res publica‚' which is often
personified‚ than of so nondescript a word as ‘res.’ In c. 37 3ο, the pre-
ceding ‘rei publicae' as well as ‘temporibus’ leaves no doubt as to the
meaning of ‘re' The archetypon probably read ‘r. p.’ (see p. 50), the
second letter having been accidentally omitted in our MSS.
