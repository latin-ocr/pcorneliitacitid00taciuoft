 

PROLEGOMENA. lxiii

(8) Regarding the stylistic coincidences, it has already been
remarked (p. xv) that the mere fact that the authorship of Pliny
no less than that of· Quintilian has been based upon them, con-
stitutes a clear reductio ad absurdum of the hypothesis itself.
¹ But this is not all, for when we examine the congeries of illus-
trations collected in ‘deadly parallel' columns, by the excessive
zeal of Kleiber, Vogel, Gruenwald and Novakstffi we find that fully
one-half are met with elsewhere, are in fact part of the common
vocabulary of Latin or of. the rhetorical vernacular of the time.
Others present no analogies or coincidences that would be recog-
nised as peculiar or significant by any one not bent upon proving a
preconceived theory. In the case of a few phrases which Quintilian
and the author of the Dialogue seem to share between them, it
would be difficult, a similar idea once being given, to express it in
dissimilar language.

Finally, amid many genuine parallelisms of diction, we at the
same time come upon most striking stylistic divergenceS. Thus,
to mention but a few instances, Tacitus is exceedingly fond of
alliterative and synonymic collocations, Quintilian habitually and
studiously avoids them, while constructions such as postquam with
plup. ind., habere with gerundive, dum with the pres. ind. in orat.
obl., liberz‘oratioss and the omission of utrum, though common in
the writings of Tacitus, never occur in Quintilian.¹²⁷

or, if he was not the author, then some one else was, Tacitus being considered
by Novak as out of the question 1 ἱ

12⁶ The only independent value of Novak's treatise consists in his adducing a
number of stylistic resemblances from the so-called Declamationes of Pseudo-
Quintilian‚ hitherto overlooked. But when he calmly regards these rhetorical
exercises as yenuine productions of Quintilian and utilises them to prove the
Quintilianean authorship of the Dialogue, he thereby at once forfeits all claims
to further consideration, even if he had not also, throughout his treatise, inten-
tionally suppressed the numerous parallelisms in the historical works of Tacitus,
while even earlier writers, such as Cicero and Livy, are mentioned not more
than 25 times in a list of over 350 alleged coincidences between the Dialogue on
the one hand and Quintilian and the Declamationes on the other!
