This being so, we should not be surprised to find distinct traces
of Tacitus' acquaintance with Seneca in the Dialogus. And accord-
ingly Peter,¹⁸⁸ starting out with this presumption, recognises this
influence “ in der Freiheit, mit welcher, wie unser Verfasser, so
auch Seneca, nur in viel ausgedehnterem Maasse als dieser, dem
Sprachgebrauch Gewalt anthut, um den Ausdruck bezeichnender
rund ausdrucksvoller zu machen⁷' and in Seneca's fondness for
epiqrammatic expressions.¹⁸⁹ Now it is curicus to observe that in
the many illustrations given by Peter of Seneca's stylistic audacity,
the Dialogus either furnishes no analogous usage or, where it does,
the expression is neither peculiar¹⁹⁰ to Seneca, nor in any way
characteristic. The same criticism holds good of the formidable
array of evidence accumulated by Kleiber.¹⁹¹ For of the 64 in-
stances of stylistic parallelisms between the Dialogus and the
writings of Seneca cited, there is not α sinqle phrase which can
confidently be regarded as a genuine reminiscence. For even in
the case of some synonymic collocations like emendatus et com-
positus (Ep. 4, 1 Dial. c. 41 2) or quietum compositumque (Ep.
100, 8 Dial. c. 36 5), which apparently do not occur elsewhere,
it were extremely rash to assert, in=view of the demonstrable
fondness for similar fullness of expression, not only in the minor
works of Tacitus, but in Latin writers generally, that they were
taken directly from Seneca! The other instances present at best
but a very remote resemblance, whether in thought or diction, or
they are of frequent occurrence elsewhere, or purely commonplace
and nondeseript.1⁹2

1⁸⁸ Einzeituny pp. 10-14.

¹⁸⁹ See also Kleiber pp. 78-80. But this is a highly characteristic feature of
the stylistic individuality of Tacitus, conspicuous in all his writings. Cp. p. xlii.

¹⁹0 This applies also to the use of incipit, = sequitur with inf. (c. 16 32), for
which Novak (p. 186) adduces a number of parallel instances from Pseudo
Quintilian's Declamationes: 26, 5 quare si apparuerit te malam causam habere,
incipis rem iniquissimam postulare 166, 5 quotiens nullum praefinitum est
tempus, incipit esse 213, 8 illo vero sublato incipit ultimum esse quod relictum
est. The others cited from 233, 9 and Quint. III 6, 17 are n·ot in point.

¹⁹1 pp. 73-80. Index locorum s. v. Seneca.

¹⁹² As it is inexpedient to reprint Kleiber's entire list, Ι must content myself
with a haphazard selection, which will, however, be sufficient to substantiate
the statement made above: hoc enim vocari solebant (Sen. Dial. II 18, 41 and
c. 1 6), toto animo incumbam (Ep. 72, 2-0. 3 13), intra se (Dial. XII 5, 1—
c. 3 12), malignis sermonibus (Dial. VII 17, l—c. 34), securum esse (Dial. II
2, l—c. 5 9), rebus prosperis (see note c. 5 24), quicquid optimum est (Dial. XII
