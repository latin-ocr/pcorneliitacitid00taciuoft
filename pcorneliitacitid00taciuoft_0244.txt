102 ’ NOTES.

note ad loc.). (3) The passage from Cicero is totally irrelevant and could at
best but prove, very superfluously at that, that the useful and the pleasurable
may be contrasted. One might with some greater show of justice have ad-
duced Cic. de orat. 1 33, 150, cited above, to prove that the genuine reading
must have been ‘quamquam utilia ι. . utiliora tamen,' for this passage at
least deals with one and the same topic.. The present chapter treats exclu-
sively de voluptate oratoria. I have no doubt that Tacitus wrote: quam-7
quam quae diu seruntur atque elaborantur grata, gratiora tamen ⁴ Although
those things which have been sown and cultivated for a long time are
pleasing (because of their maturity) yet more pleasing are ’ etc. q The
changes called for are of the easiest description. quae (ᾇ) was accidentally
omitted after quamquam (i. e. quamsi. cf. c. 18 26 tamc‘j. 32 4 quisfj. 18 1ηᾷ).
So c. 3 2 ipsum quem for ipsumque quem 39 24 quoque qui—w quoque D,
see also Buecheler, Βῆ. Mus. XI, 512 f. Grata dropped out owing to the
following gratiora. As for alia, omitted, be it observed‚ in two MSS„ it is
clearly the corruption of a dittography of diu, the d being mistaken for al,
J'ust as in analogous instances d stands for ol e. g. c. 21 :reddent (OD) =
redolent. In Hor. Ep. I 10, 37, Haupt (Opusc. III 47) conjectured victo
ridens for victor violens. The change finally of ‘a’ and ‘e' into ‘u’ and
‘ a' in the verbs can hardly be called a correction. Perhaps we ought also
to read laborantur for elaborantur, cf. c. 30 2 and note to c. 9 29, but this
is not absolutely necessary. — On the comparative following closely upon
the positive, see Cic. de orat. 1. c. and c. 9 26 pulchrum id quidem . . quanto
tamen pulchrius.

7. 1 laetiorem: Predicate adjective for adverb. Cf. H. III 38
laetos dies ageret II 22 laetam . . adulescentiam egit. Ann. XIV
61 laeti Capitolium scanderent and note to c. 4 4. The cod. Lei-
densis (B) has alone preserved ‘ipse' for the less idiomatic ‘ipso'
of the other MSS. See note to c. 3 12.

2 latus clavus oblatus: Senatorial rank and the ius honorum
were first granted to Gaul in 48 A. D. by the emperor Claudius.
See his speech, preserved in a bronze inscription found at Lyons,
ap. Nipp., Ann. Vol. II p. 314-318 and Furneaux, Vol. II p. 208-
214 and the account of Tacitus, Ann. XI 23 ff. There-after, in the
words os Tacitus (Ann. ΙΙΙ 55), used in connection with Tiberius'
policy ‘ novi homines e municipiis et coloniis atque etiam provinciis
in senatum crebro adsumpti' (especially common in the reign of
Vespasian. Cp. Hirschfeld, Rom. Verfassunqsqesclc. p. 245, 3).
The election of a novus homo to a curule office was a memorable
event, (cf. Epictet. Diss. 1, 19, 24), hence laetiorem4—On the
ὃμοιοτέλευτον here mitigated by an intervening word cf. note to
c. 4 10.
