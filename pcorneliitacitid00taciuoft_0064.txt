lxii PROLEGOMENA.

(3) Some utterances which happen to be found only in the
Dialogue and Quintilian, so far as they might not have occurred
independently to two writers like Tacitus and Quintilian, may well
owe their existence in our treatise to the fact that the youthful
author had heard them from the living lips of Quintilian, having
either remembered them or taken them from lecture notes.1²⁴

(4) There are unmistakable contradictions between the Dialogue
and the Institutio. Cf. 0. g. notes to c. 5 6 21 7 22 12 35 ext.

(5) In still other passages Quintilian seems to take direct issue
with statements made in the Dialogue. Cf. e. g. c. 12 5 23 1.

(6) The political tone, which, as we have seen, is the same
throughout the Dialogue and the historical writings of Tacitus, is
wholly different in the work of the eu'logist of Domitian.

(7) The chronological data of the life of Quintilian are absolutely
incompatible with the theory under discussion. The writer of the
Dialogue was a very young man in 75, but Quintilian nearly forty
at that time. The author of the treatise tells us that in 75 he
was still assiduously pursuing his forensic studies under the
guidance of Aper and Secundus 3 Quintilian, on the other hand, is
known to have been a pupil of Remmius Palaemon (schol. Iuv. VI
451) and especially of Domitius Afer, as he tells us himself (V 7, 7
X 1, 86). Aper is never mentioned, Secundus repeatedly (X 1, 120. ⁴
3, 12 XII 10, 11), but as an intimate friend and equal in aye
(aequalis), and when Secundus and Aper, accompanied by their
young pupil, paid their visit at the house of Maternus, Quintilian
had been for three years or more the occupant of a professorship
of rhetoric established by Vespasian.¹2⁵

124 That his pupils were wont to take notes is not only intrinsically probable‚
but is expressly attested in a well-known passage of the Institutio, I prooem. ’ἴε
duo iam sub nomine meo libri ferebantur artis rhetoricae neque editi a me
namque alterum sermonem per biduum habitum pueri, quibus id praestabatur,
exceperant, alterum pluribus sane diebus, quantam notando consequi poterant,
interceptum boni iuvenes sed nimium amantes mei temerario editionis honore
vulgaverant. Wilamowitz's (P) statement cited by Reuter p. 63 “Tacitus'
Dialog ist der'Reflex der quintilianeischen Kritik in der Seele eines Historiss
kers‚” though nicely put, is only partially true, as it implies too late a date for
the composition of the treatise. On Tacitus as a pupil of Quintilian, see Liebert
(cited note 33), Gruenwald pp. 49 ff. Walter p. 10 ff. and below, note 147.

12⁵ These chronological objections alone are so completely subversive of the
Quintilianean hypothesis, that its latest advocate, R. Novak, takes refuge in the

gratuitous supposition that Quintilian intentionally concealed his identity;
