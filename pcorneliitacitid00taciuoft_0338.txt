Brut. 17, 67. In the verdict of posterity, Cicero won a complete
triumph, although there were some in Quintilian's day who pre-
ferred his rival to all others. In the elaboration and polish of his
diction, Calvus was painstaking to'a fault, so that his style lacked
spontaneity and force. Cf. Sen. Contr. VII 4, 6 compositio quoqne

in Brut. 7 9, 27 3. The style of Caelius is characterised as harsh by
Quint. X 2, 25 (see also c. 25 18) and as not free from archaismS. (c. 21,
15-20. Cp. Teuffel ἓ 209, 5-7. His letters to Cicero, filling Bk. VIII
of the Epp. ad Fam. naturally do not furnish any criteria for
verifying these criticisms. So much seems, however, clear from
the stylistic characteristics of Caelius and Calvus cited above, that
the uncouth diction of Galba, Carbo, etc„ can never have been to
them an object of imitation, and when this is asserted even of Cicero,
the statement becomes so palpably false that it is difficult to
believe that it can have been put into Aper’s mouth by Tacitus.
Cicero⁷s earlier orations unquestionably lacked the finish and purity
of his maturer works, and he himself confessed to have profited
greatly from the study of his predecessors (cf. Quint. X 1, 41 311111
