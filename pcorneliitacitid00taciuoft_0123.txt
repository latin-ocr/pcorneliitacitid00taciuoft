allowed to perish, a few copies having, however, been taken pre-
viously. It is upon two of these apographa, as Michaelis was the
first to show, that our MSS. are based. The first family (X) is
represented by the Vaticanus 1862 (A) and the Leidensis 18 (B).
The other (Y) comprises the Farnesianus or Neapolitanus (C), the
Vaticanus 1518 (D), the Ottobonianus 1455 (E), the Vaticanus
4498 (Δ) and Vindobonensis 711 (V). Four others still remaining,
the Vindobonensis 351 (once the property of Sambucus, see note 4),
the Venetus or Marcianus, the Parisinus 7773 and the Harleianus,
are absolutely valueless, and may safely be dispensed with in any
recensio of the text of the Dialogus.²⁰⁷

We shall first give an account of the principal MSS, then pass
on to a consideration of the intricate and difficult subject of their

’ ’ interrelationship, and finally discuss the controversial question of

the respective validity of the X and Y familieS.²⁰⁸

a. Description of the MSS.

1. The codex Vaticanus 1862 (A) contains the Germania and
the Suetonius fragment, followed on pp. 23Ὀ-4310 (fol.) by the
DialoquS. The variants peculiar to this MS. are :²⁰⁹

2⁰⁷ Peterson in his recent edition has endeavored to rescue the Harleianus
(H) from what he regards as undeserved neglect. He devotes no fewer than six
pages (pp. lxxv-lxxxi) to its history and its description, and religiously records
all its readings. But even a hasty examination of his evidence ought to leave
no doubt in the mind of any unbiassed critic, that the verdict of condemnation
which Michaelis and Baehrens have passed upon this MS. is fully J'ustified.
The Harleianus is an incredibly corrupted MS. It contains not a solitary
variant of independent value‚ nor does it furnish even so much as a clue to a
genuine reading where the other MSS. are also corrupt. But Peterson’s laborious
collation possesses a negative value‚ in that it gives us a tolerably clear idea of
the character of the MS. upon which the editio princeps (Spirensis) e. g. was
based. The Parisinus, of which Ι possess a more accurate collation than the
one published by Egger (1836), is a direct offspring of the Harleianus. Peterson,
therefore, very justly remarks (p. lxxvi) that it ‘⁶ need not be referred to again
in any discussion of the text of the Dialogue. It has not, and ought never to
have been allowed, any independent value whatever.’' It is to be ‘regretted that
the editor did not see his way clear to pronounce a similar verdict upon the
equally worthless parent MS.

²⁰⁸ Since the appearance of Michaelis' edition (1868), which marks a new era
in the text critical treatment of the Dialogus, all previous discussions concern-
ing the MSS„ from Lipsius down to Orelli, Tross and Ritter, possess only an
historical interest and value‚
