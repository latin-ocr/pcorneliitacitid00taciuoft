xvi PRoLEGoMENA.

Quintilian wrote the Dialogus or neither of them did! The gamut
of possibilities had, however, not yet been run, and accordingly we
find that there were not wanting some “ scholars ' who pushed the
claims of Suetonius and even of Messalla and Maternus.⁵ That
no one should have espousedgthe cause of Aper or Secundus may,
under the circumstances, well excite our astonishment.

But the claims of Quintilian and Pliny to the authorship of our
treatise, having been exposed as worthless, the sceptics, forced to
concede their ignoranoe of the real author, were now content to
attribute the work to some anonymous cultured contemporary.⁶
Thus the question, after traversing many by—paths, had returned to
the point, where Lipsius’ ³ non liquere ² had placed it, and so even
Eolcstez'n (1835), to whom we owe a masterly discussion of the
entire controversy, after successfully refuting most of the arguments
against Tacitean authorship, closes by saying “ summam superesse
difficultatem in dicendi genere a Taciti usu plane abhorrente
positam, quare totam rem, dum meliora proferuntur, in medio
relinquendam esse censuimus) The most persistent and obstinate
advocate of the ‘ anonymous ’ theory was Η. Gutmann (1830). He
again emphasised the stylistic objections, but went beyond his pre-
decessors by contending that the style showed evident signs of a
decadence in taste and that the matter, barring perhaps the chapter
on the education of children, was unworthy of Tacitus. “Der
Herrliche verliert nichts bei diesem Spiel, er gewinnt vielmehr''
(p. 148). Gutmann, following a hint thrown out by Lipsius, also
objected to the phrase ‘iuvenis admodum' as incompatible with the
ascertainable data of the life of Tacitus. ·

The supporters of the Tacitean authorship, always few in num-
bers, had hitherto been forced to assume a defensive and apologetic
attitude. The genuineness of the Dialogus was more or less an
article of faith with them rather than a subject capable of demon-
stration one way or another. However successfully the claims of
Quintilian and Pliny had been repulsed, there still remained the
palpable difference in style which the opponents never wearied in
pointing out as the one great argument, decisive against Tacitean
authorship. The problem thus presented could not be ignored with
impunity nor explained on the ground that the author was still
