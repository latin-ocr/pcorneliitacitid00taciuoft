Gallus.—siccus=‘aridus, exilis, inaniS, 1611111115, strigosus ξηρός’
opposed to ‘uber, plenus.' Cf. Quint. XI 1, 32 siccum et solli-
citum et contractum dicendi propositum Gen. XIV 1, 32 sicca et
incondita et propemodum ieiuna and Quint. X 2, 17 tristes 61
16111111 Pollionem aemulantur. -Although Aper does not shrink
from exaggeration and misrepresentation, 11 11 511115 his purpose,
I cannot believe that he here intends to say that Asinius faithfully
reproduced the style and manner of the old poets 'throuqhout his
orations no less than in his tragedies. It seems much more natural
and plausible 130 assume that his contentiori, be it true or 13156,
was this: In the tragedies 01 Asinius, Pacuvius and Accius live
over again and even in his speeches we constantly find the same
archaic flavor.

All that is necessary to bring 0111 this meaning is the insertion of ‘in'
before ⁴ orationibus‚' which easily dropped out owing 10 the preceding ‘m.'
The capricious change from an instrumental abl. 10 3 prepositional phrase,
though peculiarly characteristic 01 Tacitus, is still rare in the minor writ-
ings. Cp. Kubera, Die tacit. Inconcinnitdt p. 16 Dr. Stil ξ 105. The
present instance, however, as well as c. 31 35, 15 1101 3 0356 in point, for in
both these passages a difference 01 meaning] is involved. Cf. crit.- note 0.

oratio autem sicut corpus hominis :. A beautifully elaborated meta-
phor. On the favorite characterisation 01 stylistic or rhetorical
qualities by terms relating to the human body, see note 0. 21 4.
To the parallel instances there cited, add 0. 3119 1. orator . . . tenebit
venas animorum et . . . adhibebit manum et temperabit orationem
Cic. de orat. I 52, 223 orator teneat oportet venas cuiusque generis
Plin. Ep. V 8, 10 hanc (sc. historiam) saepius ossa, musculi, nervi,
illam (sc. orationem) tori quidam . . . decent.

37 nec per ipsum stetit: ² cannot even be held responsible in his
own person‚' a common idiom usually followed by ‘quominus,'
rarely by ³ quin' or ‘ ne.' Nec=ne — quidem as in 0. 8 26, where see
note. Cp. also G. 6 Ann. XI 30 XII 43 XIV 55 and Dr. H. S. II 73.

39 videmus enim quam: ‘for we observe, how little) This sig-
nification 01 ³ quam,' especially after ‘ videre ' is also idiomatic and
frequent in Cicero. Cf. Rhet. ad Her. IV 20 videt. . ,quam conveniat
Cic. de orat. II 31, 133 111 videatis quam sit genus hoc (‘ how unim-
portant! Wilkins less justly, it would seem, reads quale with
codd. mutili) 42, 180 vide quam sim . . . deus ‘how far I am from
being a god in such matters' III 14, 51 vides quain alias res agamus
