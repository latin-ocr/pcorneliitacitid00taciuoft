is added (Ann. XIV 10 tumulo matris), or with two nouns (Ann.
'XIV 61 imagines . . . foro ac templis statuunt), less often with
single substantives, as here and e. g. H. ΙΙ 16 V 4. 5 Ann. XIII 5

Ov. Her. ΙΙ 67 and Tac. H. III 74 do not refer to sepulchral
statues, Dronke absurdly interprets the phrase in the sense of
sepeliri 1- maestus et atrox etc. ε i. e. not sorrowful and fierce of
countenance, as may be natural in an orator whose life was ever
‘inquieta et anxia' (c. 12) and passed amid ‘sordes ac lacrimas

honors, believing that his own works will constitute a more lasting
monument. See below. —pro for the more usual dative or the abl.
