3 nemo intra paucissimas perorare horas cogebatur: Cf. Plin.
Ep. VI 2, 6 an nos sapientiores maioribus nostris ἱ) nos legibus ipsis
iustiores, quae tot horas, tot dies, tot comperendinationes largiuntur?
hebetes illi et supra modum tardi? nos apertius dicimus, celerius
intellegimus qui paucioribus clepsydris praecipitamus causas quam
diebus explicari solebant ?——‘perorare' is simply a strengthened
‘orare' and signifies, as often, the formal oration or the ‘plaidoyer'
proper. Cf. e. g. Cic. de fin. IV 1, 1 (cited to 1. 6) Tac. Ann. II 30
certabant cui ius perorandi daretur III 17 cum accusatores ac
testes certatim perorarent Plin. Ep. I 20, 8. As the appropriate
place for such speeches was at the close of the evidence, the term
by an easy transference came to designate a summing up.

4 liberae comperendinationes erant: Postponements extending
over the second or third day. Cf. Cic. pro Mur. 12, 27 statuere .
non potuisse utrum diem tertium an perendinum . dici opor-
teret. For the form ‘comperendinatim‘ not met with in pre-Aug.
writers, Cicero uses ‘comperendinatus' (Verr. II 1, 9, 26).—Modum
. . . sumebat is simply an amplification of the preceding, but was
added to emphasise as strongly as possible the unrestricted free-
dom of action enjoyed by ancient advocates. This is in direct
opposition to Aper's view (c. 19 9 fh), who. had extolled the modern
practice which confined the pleader to the immediate point at
issue. The technical character of this entire discussion with its
learned and concrete illustrations is again, unless we suppose Tac.
to have been incredibly careless in the ἠθοποιΐα of his dramatis
personae, at variance with the theory that the poet Maternus is
the speaker.

‘horas' is omitted in most MSS„ but written above the line in A, and
preceded by the letter s. (i. e. scilicet) in C. This points unmistakably to
‘ paucissimas horas perorare ' or ‘paucissimas perorare horas ' as the original
reading of the archetypon. The latter seems preferable, ‘horas' easily
dropping out after ⁴ -orare.' Dr. E. Thomas suggests (by letter) that ‘horas '
is an explanatory gloss and that we have here an ellipsis similar to the one
discussed in note c. 218 Calvi (sc. librum) in Asitium legit, but this inter-
pretation, though ingenious, seems less natural and somewhat hazardous
without the support of parallel illustratione—dicendi has no MS. authority,
for A, according to Andresen's ree'xamination of this codex, also reads
‘dicendo’ There can, therefore, be no doubt that ‘in dicendo' is the
original. ‘in' having dropped out, because of the preceding ⁴ m,’ ‘dicendo‘
was changed to ‘dicendi’ e. g. in the worthless cod. Parisinus and in the
oldest printed editions. Cf. c. 7 5 quantulaecunque in dicendo facultatis
