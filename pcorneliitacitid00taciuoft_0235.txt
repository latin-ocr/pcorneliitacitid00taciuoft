 

C. 5. 6. 93

quibus philosophorum placita, where the preceding noun probably
prevented the use of sapientium. Cp. Woelfflin, Philol. XXVI 141.
On the spare use of Greek words in Tac„ cf. Nipp„ Ann. XIV 16. —
Observe the remarkable accumulation of military phrases through-
out this chapter (armatus, praesidium, munitus, lorica et gladius
—incessere, accinctus, inexercitatam, certaminum3 elusit—from
fencing). Cicero and Quintilian and above all Tacitus are extremely
fond of this class of metaphors. Cp. D. Wollner., Progr. Landau
1886 and Mayor, Iuv. VII 17 3 (vol. I p. 314. 454 ᾗ). ——dicturumz
On the ellipsis of esse, cf. c. 2 13.

6. 1 voluptatem cuius iucunditas: Although ‘iucunditas' is often
used as a synonym of ³ voluptas,’ we find the poets occasionally
employing ‘iucundus' as an epithet of the latter. Cf. Munro to
Lucret. II 3 who cites Prop. Ι 10, 3 Aetna 251.

2 non uno aliquo momento: unus aliquis serves as a kind of sub-
stitute for the singular of ‘singuli' which was not in use. Cf. Tac.
H. Ι 6. 13 Sen. de vit. beat. III 2 and so also Cic. in Caec. 7 , 9
in Verr. II 1, 24, 62 de orat. II 72, 292 de off. II 12, 41. —omnibus
prope diebus ac prope omnibus horis: The unusual position of the
second ‘prope ² (see c. 17 5) imparts special emphasis. For the col·
location of dies and hora, cf. Cat-ull. XXXVIII 3 in dies et horas
Hor. Sat. II 6, 47 in diem et horam Sen. Ep. 101, 1 omnis dies,
omnis hora. Oratory, Aper contends, affords a perpetual delight,
while poetry is at best but a gaudium volucre (c. 9 14 ff.).

3 libero et ingenuo: Aiso eombined in cio. Brut. 67, 236, bufias
usual in inverse order. Cf. note c. 4 3.

4 plenam semper et frequentem: Cf. Sen. de ira ΙΙ 8, 1 cum
videris forum multitudine refertum et septa concursu omnis fre-

quentiae plena.
6 idque: Que joins a whole sentence, as in c. 14 3 suspicatusque

Ag. 33 H. I 39 II 49 Ann. III 13 and· so quite regularly with ³ id.7

Cf. Lex. Tac. p. 701 f. —pecuniae: The profession of law was an
extremely lucrative one during the early empire, the lex Cincia

having become quite a dead letter, until the time of Claudius, who
according to Tac. Ann. XI 7 capiendis pecuniis posuit modum us-
que ad dena sestertia, quem egressi repetundarum tenerentur.—
On the wealth of Marcellus and Crispus cf. c. 8 5 and in general,
Friedlander 1⁶ 326 ff. — orbitati: On the notoriously common prac-
tice of legacy—hunting among the Romans, cf. Hor. Sat. II 5, 28 ff.
