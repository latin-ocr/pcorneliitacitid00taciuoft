cannot be assigned to one sinqle speaker, be his name Messalla,

Secundus or Maternus, because of the heterogeneous character of

’ their contents.1⁶1

Α Another theory was advanced by Heumann, who contended that
j· a lacuna must be assumed after the words ‘faces admovebant,'

¹, because of the want of any organic connection with what follows.
’,· The words cited he regarded as the close of Messalla’s argument,
³s while the remainder was assigned to Maternus. This view did not
v find a champion till Becker¹⁶² strongly advocated it a century later,
with the modification, however, that he too assumed the preceding

speaker to have been SecunduS, his grounds being similar to those

’ advanced by Steiner. But this explanation was also neglected or

ι rejected, until Andresen, fifty years still later, again returned to the
original hypothesis of Heun1ann,¹⁶³ adding, what his predecessors
⁴ had failed to do, a few passages as evidence of the contradictory
character between the two parts. Finally the whole question was

÷ taken up anew by Habbe,1⁶⁴ who in turn argues in favor of Becker's
· solution of the problem.

, The great majority of editors and critics, however, obstinately
’ hold to the view that everything from c. 36 to 42 was spoken by

'· Maternus, some of these clinging to the belief that Secundus did

² not speak at all,¹⁶⁵ while others maintain that he did s0, but that

his contribution to the debate, together with the close of Messalla's
j, argument and the beginning of Maternus', was lost in the lacuna,166
'¹ which they in consequence assume to be one of considerable
, magnitude.

, 1⁶1 When Steiner also argues that Pontanus (the cod. B is the apographon of
ν his copy, now lost) left the middle of p. 30² and the whole of p. 30¹³ vacant, in

ἶ the hope that the lost speech of Maternus might some day turn up, his prejudices
J allowed him to forget that if such had been Pontanus’ motive, we should, to
3 say the least, have expected some space to have been left vacant aster the word
ἃ ‘utatur‚' and not merely at the close of the entire treatise ! Cp. also Baehrens
