p. 8 f.. Peter's assertion that the word is found a few times in
later writers cannot be verified. .

4 non suffecturi honoribus ² incompetent to hold office! Cf.
Suet. Octav. 43 pro magistratibus 4qui non sufficerent and Tac.
Ann. Ι 13 quippe Augustus supremis sermonibus cum tractaret,
quinam adipisci principem locum suffecturi abnuerent, where ¹ suf-
fecturi ² seems to be used absolutely, as in G. 13 sed arma sumere
non ante cuiquam moris quam civitas suffecturum probaverit.—
¹non impetrarent’ designates the result of their indolence (inertes),
‘impetratos (sc. honores) etc.' that of their incompetence.

5 nescio an occurs inssac. only here and Ann. ΙΙΙ 53. On the
syntactical use of the phrase, see R. V. ΠΙ 308 f. notes 440 f. with
the many references there cited.

6 haec vetera: i. e. the speeches of the republican period. For
‘vetus' in this restricted sense, see Tac. Ann. IV 32 veteres populi
Romani res composuere and note c. 19 9.

‘vetera' as a neuter substantive occurs also in Hor. Ep. II 1, 23 sic
fautor veterum, which parallel disposes of the emendations of Baehrens
and Andresen.

et· · · manent et contrahuntur} i. e. These oratorical documents
are still preserved in the private libraries of antiquarians and are
even now being issued in abridged selections by Mucianus and
thus rendered more generally accessible. Only with this inter-
pretation of ‘contrahere,' as John well points out, is the con-
trast indicated by ‘et . . . et' brought out. Cf. Quint. X'7, 31
Ciceronis ad praesens modo tempus aptatos (sc. commentarios)
libertus Tiro contraxit, opp. to ³ in libros digesti' (ξ 30), where see
Peterson and perhaps XII 11, 16 quaelibet enim ex iis artibus . . .
in paucos libros contrahi solet.

7 cum maxime ‘at present.' Cf. note e. 16 29.—Mucian0: C.

Licinius Mucianus, the Warwick os: Roman history, was in com-.

mand of Syria in 67, three times consul suffectus (c. 66 A. D. 70
and 72) and chiefly instrumenta] in placing Vespasian upon the
throne. He died between 75 and 77. See Proleg. p. xxv f. His
character is repeatedly sketched by Tacitus e. g. H. Ι 10 L. M. vir
secundis adversisque iuxta famosus . . . attritis opibus, lubrico
statu, suspecta etiam Claudii iracundia, in secretum Asiae seposi-
tus ta1i1 prope ab exule fuit quam postea a principe . . . malis
