Α11(1 11118 111011, 11 18 seriously contended, was not likely, at the
age of 27, to have had any desire to discuss or the requisito intel-
lectual equipment and maturity to fathom a problem which must
needs have suggested itself to every educated observer of the liter-
‘ary characteristics 01 1118 time! But, if we must assume that
Tacitus could have had no scruples in calling himself ‘iuvenis
admodum' with reference 130 1110 days of his forensic apprentice-
ship, inasmuch as he even styles himself ³ iuvenis,’ at the beginning
of Domitian's reign,³⁴ is the phrase itself properly applicable to a
youth of 21 ⁴? There is 11013 13110 slightest doubt of it, for words
designating time of life are of an extremely 0108110- 11011110 111

would still have had a very strong motive for intentionally pre-
senting himself as younger than he actually was, in order to
account for the certainly strange circumstance that he, though

84 Ag. 3 tot annis (i. e. 81-96 A. n.), quib⁸us iuvenes ad senectutem (at the age
of 42 Ξ) . . . per silentium venimus. Cp. also Ag. 9 consul filiam iuveni mihi

³⁵ Thus e. g. Nepos (Att. 8, 2) speaks of Brutus as ‘ adulescens ’ at the age of
37, of Hamilcar and Eumenes as ‘peradulescentes,' when 21 years old. Sallust
(Cat. 3) styles himself ‘adulescens ’ at 1110 age of 34, and Caesar (Cat. 49) at 36
‘ adulescentulus.’ Pompey in his 24th year was still ‘ peradulescens‚' according
to Cic. (pro leg. Man. 21). Cicero himself was ‘ adulescens’ at the age 01 26,
when he defended Roscius (Orat. 30, 107), and Gell. XV 28, 5 111 speaking of
the same trial uses the phrase ‘admodum adulescens.' Crassus when 21 years
old is ‘ adulescentulus ' and ‘ admodum adulescens ' (Cic. de 011. II 13, 47 Brut.
43, 159). In Cic. Phil. V 17, 48 we read ‘superior Africanus, T. Flamininus
admodum adulescentes ‘consules facti. Vell. Pat. II 41, 3 styles Caesar when 24
‘admodum iuvenis,' and Quint. (XII 6, 1) finally goes so far as to designate
Demosthenes at the age 01 21 08 ‘ admodum puerum ' ἱ Cp. also Eckstein p. 37
Haase p. XVI note 62 Weinkauff p. XXIX. XLIII. CLVII Jansen p. 34 f.

⁸⁰ Cp. Nipp. Andr. Einl. Ann. p. 7 “ Denn frfihestens ist diese Bezeichnung
wohl fiir das 17te J ahr anwendbar, mit welchem die toga virilis angelegt wurde;
wie weit sie aber 1111· (108 spatere Alter ausgedehnt werden konnte, wird sich bei
dem Schwankenden, dass alle Altersangaben dieser Art haben, kaum bestimmen

lassen.'’ It is very remarkable that Andresen‚ who so strenuously objeets to .

the phrase ‘ admodum iuvenis,' should have allowed the above words to stand,

although he quietly omitted other equally important passages from Nipperdey's
original introduction. See note' 29.
