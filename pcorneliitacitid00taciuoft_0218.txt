where a long list of other authorities is cited—clientelae: Colo-
nies and municipalities were won't to place themselves under the
protection of some illustrious Roman citizen who thus became their
patron and who acted as their legal representative in all matters
that came under imperial jurisdiction. The precise relations of the
patronus and his client are enveloped in much obscurity because
ancient authorities usually leave us to guess the chronological
periods to which their remarks on this subject are applicable. Cp.

19 suffeceris: The perf. subj. is here used for the regular con-
struction with the imperf. to express Aper's conviction more po-
litely. There seems, therefore, no valid reason for regarding
‘suffeceris' as independent of the conditional clause, the apodosis
having to be supplied by some thought as ‘to which you would not
even prove equal if ² (² und auch dann nicht gewachsen sein wurdest‚
wenn' Andresen and similarly Peter), an interpretation which also
completely loses sight of the force of etiam si.

20 novum negotium etc. refers to the poetic activity of Maternus
in general. Aper contends that an advocate so much sought after
as Maternus, can ill afford to devote his precious time to such un-
profitable employment as writing dramas, if he at all desires consci-
entiously to do his full duty by his numerous clients. Vahlen
Prooem. 1878-9 p. 4 ff. pointed out a slight inconsistency in the clos-
ing clause of this chapter. For the words, as they stand, clearly
imply the absurd assumption that Maternus would find more time

 

for the discharge of his forensic obligationS, if his poetic Muse ·

contented itself with the occasional production of tragedies based
upon the hackneyed themes of Greek story, instead of writing prae-
textatae! Nevertheless, R. Scholl (Commeat. Wocffin p. 393-99)
partially upholds this view, alleging that Aper, though he regards
the composition of a Greek tragedy as sheer waste of time, would
yet allow Maternus to dramatise Roman subjects because these,
at least, call for higher intellectual effort and originality, and
are as such not unworthy of the attention of a true Roman!
