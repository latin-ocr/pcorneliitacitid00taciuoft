the term to Agrippa, although he lived some seventy years after
Demosthenes and Hyperides, This in itself is sufficient to betray
the casuistical character of his previous contention. Cf. also c. 18 4,
where he even includes SerV. Galba and C. Carbo among those who
may properly be styled ³ antiqui) .

To the argument in favor of the easy emendation ‘voletis,’ adduced
c. 1 6, we may add that ‘soletis’ is also not in keeping with ‘ut puto,'
which does not express a genuine doubt, but is used with evident irony.
‘For I don't suppose that, notwithstanding your blind partiality for the
ancients, you would go so far as to prefer even Menenius Agrippa to the
eloquent speakers of our day ! ’

3 Caesarem etc: C. Julius Caesar (B. c. July 13. lOo—March
15. 44), Μ. Caelius Rufus (c. 88—48), O. Licinius Macer Calvus
(March 28. 82-0, 47), M. Junius Brutus (c. 7 9—42), C. Asinius
Pollio (76 Β. c, ——5 A. D.), M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus (c. 64 Β. o.
—c. 8 A. n). On the oratorical characteristics of these men, see
below.

5 quid=‘ cur,' in indirect questions is common in poetry, espe-
cially in pre-classic writers, but, with the exception of Livy, very

XXXI 39 quid venisset, nuntiatum XXXIV 61 XL 15. (Cp.
Kuhnast, Liv. Synt. p. 18 ff.) Val. Max. Ι 5, 3 interrogavit quid
ita eo vultu esset I 7, 5 (Dr. H. S. II 482 ἱ). Peter's examples

periods.—ipso not ‘ipse' because Cicero is especially singled out
from the rest. —- Consistent usage in the Dialogus leaves no doubt
as to the inadmissibility of the collocation ‘ant temp. potius!
Of. e. g. ο. 13.15 62 127 137 2215 294 3413.

7 Tiro libertus eius: M. Tullius Tit-0, Cicero’s Boswell, was
