PROLEGOMEN A. XV

critics felt themselves on safer ground, if they attributed the
work to a well-known author rather than to some intangible
unknown individual. Among the better known scholars who
espoused this view, may be mentioned Gruter, Gronovius, Graevius,
Dousa, Freinsheim, Fabricius, Pichena and above all C. Α. Heumann, Heumann.
in his edition of the Dialogue published exactly two hundred years
after Rhenanus. Their arguments were chiefly based upon the
stylistic similarity between the Dialogue and the Institutio Oratoria.
The insuperable chronological difficulties in the way of this hypoth-
esis, though hinted at by Lipsius and strongly emphasised by
Dodwell, were either studiously ignored or curtly dismissed as
irrelevant. It remained for Spaldinq, in a long note to Quint. VI Spaldiny.
prooem. 3 (vol. ΙΙ [1803] pp. '424 fh), to deal the final death·
>blow to the view held so obstinately and so long, although R.
Novak has quite recently again made a laborious attempt to resus-
citate the Quintilian theory, ‘non melius,' to use Aper's words,
‘ quam [alii] sed felicius quia illum fecisse pauciores sciunt.'

Lipsius' non liquere, however, opened wide the door for other
conjectures regarding the real author, for the orthodox view had
still but few supporters, the idea that the stylistic problem was
capable οξ a solution being as yet entertained by no one. In 1778,
I. I. H. Nast published a German translation οξ the Dialogue, in Nast.
which, for the first time, the younger Pliny enters the list οξ com-
petitors for the authorship οξ the treatise. The arguments of Nast
were based on the same grounds which had prompted so many
previous Scholars to declare in favor of Quintilian,—alleged re-
markable parallelisms in thought and diction, the biographical data
οξ Pliny being violently twisted into conformity with the evidence,
historical and literary, furnished by the Dialogus. Nast’s hypoth-
esis was subsequently championed by Wittioh, Kramarczik and
especially elaborated by Fr. Hess, To say that this view has been Hess.
finally disposed of by Eckstein, Gutmann and Vogel is perhaps
hazardous, for Pliny may still find some belated supporter as did
Quintilian! It may, however, be remarked, that if we are forced
to assign any argumentative validity whatever to the numerous
stylistic parallelisms adduced in favor οξ Pliny and οξ Quintilian,
only one οξ two inferences will be possible: Either Pliny and

may have been inserted, on the authority οξ Lipsius, by Johannes Sambucus
(1531-1584), to whom this MS. is known to have belonged.
