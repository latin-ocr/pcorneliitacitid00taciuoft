abstract noun as predicate (quod gaudium). Dr. H. S. II p. 425 ff.
omits this example.

17 coram: in conspectum (sc. oratoris), according to its original
meaning (Hand, Tursell. II 126) 0. g. Hor. Sat. I 6, 56 ut veni
coram (Maecenatis). The hearers crowd close up to the speaker
to catch every word3 proximity makes them the more easily sus-
ceptible of the emotions which the orator assumes.

There is, therefore, no reason for deserting the MS. reading in favor of
coronam, an emendation of Acidalius which is, moreover, open to the ob-
jection raised by John in his excellent discussion of this passage (Wartemb.
Correspbl. I p. 4 f.)‚ that it would be a mere repetition of populus which,
according to a common usage in the Dial. and elsewhere, signifies the

‘listening public’ in the law court or the theatre and the like. Cf.
note c. 19 9.

accipere adiectum · · induerit: Adfectum ‘emotions The word
often has to do duty for the Greek πάθος as well as ἦθος for which
latter the Latin language had no exact equivalent. See the elabo-
rate discussion in Quint. VI 2, 1—09.—The underlying figure is
that of a dress which one can put on or off at pleasure. The meta-

adfectus in hoc posita est ut moveamur ipsi XI 3, 58 and Hor.
A. P. 101 si vis me flere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi, all insist
that the orator must actually feel, not merely simulate for the
occasion the emotions which he wishes to excite in his hearers.
Cf. note c. 2 3. The entire passage beginning with ‘iam vero' is
again largely modelled upon Cic.: de orat. I 8, 31 quid enim est aut
tam admirabile quam ex infinita multitudine hominum existere
unum. 25, 116 magnum quoddam est onus atque munus suscipere
atque profiteri se esse omnibus silentibus unum, maximis de rebus,

similar eulogy of the lawyer’s profession, see Iuv. VIII 47 ff. The
construction ³ adfectum induere' finds a perfect analogue in the
