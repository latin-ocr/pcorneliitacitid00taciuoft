PROLEGOMENA. xix

Haase's valuable commentatio de Taciti vita, ingeniO, scriptiS,

Franz Weinlcauff' published his first dissertation, De Taciti Dialogo, Weinlcauff.

with an index comparativus, which was followed by an index
Latinitatis in 1859. With the appearance of these weighty con-
tributions, we enter upon a new phase of the controversy, charac-
terised by a more or less general acquiescence in the genuineness
of the Dialogus. Laying due stress upon the many remarkable
points of agreement in the general mode of thought and feeling,
the criticisms on men and measures between our treatise and the
historical writings of TacituS, seme of which Lange and Eckstein
had previously collected, Weinkauff for the first time instituted an
exhaustive stylistic and rhetorical Π comparison which showed that
the stylistic resemblanceS, even down to minutiae, were more
numerous and striking than even the most ardent advocates of
Tacitean authorship could have expected. Nevertheless, there
were not wanting criticS, like Bernhardy, who still insisted that
these coincidences were after all not sufficient to counterbalance
the equally striking dzfferences, and these Weinkauff, like all his
predecessors, had failed to account for satisfactorily. That was
reserved for Eduard Woelfflin who, in a series of articles in the
Philologus, beginning in 1868, proved conclusively by a large
number of apt illustrations that this stylistic difference is the
result of‘ a genetic development which we are still able to trace
through the works of the historian, ‘dass in dem Stile des Tacitus,'
to use his own words, ‘nicht nur das Individuelle von dem der
Zeit Angehorigen zu scheiden ist, sondern dass das erstere Element
in den fruheren Schriften noch weniger zur Geltung kommt, sich
im weiteren Verlauf des Schreibens starkt, und dass schliesslich
Tacitus in den Annalen, wir wollen nicht sagen am besten schreibt,
aber eben erst der wahre Tacitus ist!12

Five years before Woelfflin's epoch-making investigations,

E. Woelfflin.

Steiner's famous ‘Programm' appeared, in which the paramount &einer-

validity of the MS. testimony is for the first time properly em-

remarkable. The quotations under notice were simply called forth by two lost
letters of Tacitus, to which Pliny’s epistles I 6 and IX 10 are the extant replies.

Schwabe's unqualified support of Lange's inference even in his last revision of
Teuffel's R'om. Lit.⁵ ξ 331, 1, can, in my opinion, be explained only on the
ground of ‘ Pietat ⁹ or negligence.
