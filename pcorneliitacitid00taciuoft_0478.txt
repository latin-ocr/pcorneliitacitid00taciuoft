2 eadem ratio - · · in nostra quoque civitate: The same explana-
tion, Secundus sayS, by which I accounted for the supreme excel-
lence of Attic eloquence, holds good for republican Rome. —That
Secundus had previously spoken of the Greek orators, is made
evident by ‘ nostra quoquc civitate.’ A discussion of Greek oratory
might seem irrelevant at first sight, it was, however, foreshadowed
by the remark of Messalla in c. 15 13 ff. quod quibusdam solacio
est, mihi auget quaestionem quia video etiam Graecis accidisse
etc. An explanation of this remarkable coincidence, after having
once been pointed out, was imperatively called for, and the author
very appropriately assigned this task to Secundus, the scholar and
historian in the company, but the exposition itself was lost to-
gether with the beginning of his speech.

’ 4 consecuti sunt etc: i. e. although the orators of our day have
also acquired a fair share of influence (cp. Aper's speech, esp. c.
8 4. 17 ff), so far as this is compatible with the more regulated
and better organized order of things, existing under the present ff
monarchical government, still the ancients believed that they
could secure greater persona] prestige by following an oratorical
career than in any other vocation, for amid the anarchical con-
dition of affairs and in the absence of a single ruler, the influence
of the individual grew in direct ratio to his ability to control the

wavering populace by his eloquence.

I am unable to see the slightest J'ustification for the many violent
changes which Andresen (Emend. p. 127-129 Critical Appendiae to his
edit.3) has (leemed fit to introduce into the text. His arguments rest
partly upon the erroneous assumption that Messalla is the speaker, partly
upon the supposition that the subject of ‘videbantur' is ‘horum temporum
oratores,' whereas it is clearly ⁶ antiqui‚' as shown by illa. So similarly
in c. 38 2 illud forum refers to ⁴ veteres.' — ‘ sibi' belongs to ‘ adsequi' and
‘plura' is predicative, the full comparison having to be supplied asin the
above paraphrase. See also J ohn's note ad loc.
