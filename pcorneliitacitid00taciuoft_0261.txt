mur. Quint. X 1, 48 invocatione dearum quas praesidere vatibus
creditum est. XII 10, 24 ipsum (sc. Platonem). . . instinctis
divino spiritu vatibus comparandum. The etymology of ‘vates’ is
very doubtful. Varro L. L. VII 36, in his na‘i've way, derived it
from versibus viendis. Moderns generally connect the term with
Irish faith. Gr. φάτης, Lat. fari, fabula are different. Mommsen²
Hermes XVI 620 note 4 supposes a Gallio origin, on the basis of
Strabo IV 4, 4 p. 198 τρία φῦλα τῶν τιμωμένων . . . Βάρδοι τε καὶ
Οῧάτεις καὶ Δρυΐδαι. On the use of vates and poeta, cp. L. Muller,
de re metr. p. 65-68, Ennius p. 27-29, Seyff.-Mull. Lael. p. 165.
The purist Tacitus never uses ‘poeta' except in the Dialogus,
where it could not well have been avoided. See also note on sapi-

10 deducit, salutat, prosequitur, are all more or less technical
terms. Deduoere is to escort the statesman or orator from his home to
the forum 01· the senate as a mark of honor or respect, ——more rai-ely
in the sense of reducere ³ to accompany back to his house.⁷ Cf. Cic·

different sense 0. 34 3. —salutare ‘to pay a visit,' usually early in
the morning, one of the chief ‹luties the client owed his patron.
Gk. θεραπεύειν Or ἀσπάζεσθαι, Cf. Plut. l. C. 16 Ρ. 868 ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰς

lander, I 382 ff. Becker, Gallus II3 159 ff. Mayor ad Iuv. I 128
III 127 V 19 ff. See Maternus' answer 0. 11 13. —prosequi either
synonymous with ‘adsectari’ in the general sense of ‘accompanying,'
as in c. 2 7 quos . . . in publico adsectabar, or perhaps better taken
as the opposite of deducere (de domo). Cf. Gell. XVIII 1, 16
prosecuti Favorinum in domum, and Ann. XI 12. Andresen and
Wolff take prosequi to mean ‘ to accompany on travels,' but as the
impoverished Bassus (c. 9 25) was not likely to travel extensively,
Aper's remark would savor of facetiousness, bordering on sarcasm.
