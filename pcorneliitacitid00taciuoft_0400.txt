numerous emendations proposed as an unnecessary tampering with the
text. Cp. Andresen, Emend. p. 148-150 John, Gorrespbl. p. 29 f.—Ioh.
Muller, followed by Wolff and Andresen, ingeniously conjectured ‘qua-
quasi cominus nisus' on the analogy of Tac. Ann. IV 51 adversum resi-
stentis cominus niti fatetur. But ⁶ qua' for ‘si’ is not called for, as has
been shown, nor is ‘quasi ’ needed, soff-Tacitus and other post-Augustam
writers freely dispense with apologies for unusual metaphors. See E.
Wolff, Einlec‘t. p. 14 f. ‘nisus' is also superfluous, for Ι cannot see why
‘ cominus ' may not have the meaning which was given to it above. Finally‚
it is intrinsically improbable that three words were omitted in the MSS.
Nissen's easy emendation ‘comminans' revived by Vahlen, is, in my judg-
ment out of place, as I am unable to recognise any threat in the words of
Aper in c. 18 7 agere enim fortius iam et audentius volo.

9 plures=complures. The only instance of this confusion in
the Dialogus, though exceedingly common in the other writings of
Tacitus. See Lex. Tac. p. 882b-8832. It seems to occur first in
the Bell. Afric. Cp. Archiv, VI 91 and in general, Schmalz, Antib.

Tac. also Ann. XIV 21 eloquentiae primas nemo tulit. With ‘tri-
-buere’ e. g. Cic. Orat. 5, 18 cui vel primas eloquentiae patrum
nostrorum tribuebat aetas 17, 56.—De1nosthenes and Cicero are
habitually grouped together as marking the zenith of oratical great-
ness 'in antiquity. Cp. the beautiful antithesis in Hieron. ad

· Nepot. de vita cleric. ε Demosthenes tibi (sc. Ciceroni) praeripuit,

ne esses primus orator 3 tu illi ne solus. — Aeschines et Hyperides
et Lysias et Lycurgus: The names of the Greek, as well as those
of the Roman orators, enumerated immediately below, are not
arranged chronologically, but in the order of merit. Quint. X 1, 76
agrees with this critical estimate: Decem (sc. oratores) simul Athe-
nis aetas una tulit quorum longe princeps Demosthenes . . . Aesch.
Hyp. . . . Lysias, Thecoincidence has been thought highly signi-
ficant. It ceases to be so, when we observe that Quintilian pro·
ceeds to discuss Isocrates, while Lycurgus is never so much as even
mentioned throughout the entire Institutio.

The editors of the Dial. have with singular unanimity rejected ⁴ autem’
before ‘locum' It is, however, eminently proper in this place, as shown
by the succeeding symmetrically constructed clause: Cicero . . . Calvus
autem. It is the second ⁴ autem ' that ought to have been obJ'ected to, and
I feel convinced that the original reading was ‘tamem' The corruption
was either due to the false solution of an illegible compendium, or to meta-
