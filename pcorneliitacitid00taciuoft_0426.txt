³ pliable‚ young.² In this sense, the word is rare but classic. See
Seyffi-M'ull. Lael. p. 61 Schmalz, Antii). II 676. It is exactly
equivalent to Gk. ὑγρός, as used in the almost identical passage irr
ΡΞ. Plut. l. 0. εὔπλαστον γὰρ καὶ ᾑγρὸν ἡ νεότης καὶ ταῖς τούτων
ψυχαῖς ἁπαλαῖς (= teneri animi) ἔτι τὸ. μαθήματα ἐντήκεται
(z imbuuntur). On the thought, cp. also Sen. Dial. IV 21, 10

XII 18, 8 altius praecepta descendunt quae teneris imprimuntur
aetatibus and Quint. I 1, 2 ante omnia ne sit vitiosus sermo nutri-

All our MSS. either read or unmistakably point to virides as the original,
and as the word has been shown to be wholly unobjectionable, we have no
right to reject it. Nevertheless, editors, with the laudable exception of Wolff,
write ‘teneri . . . rudes animi,' regarding ‘virides’ either as an explanatory
gloss or as a dittography (so Halm) of ‘rudes'l But no motive which can
possibly have induced a scribe or reader to explain so intelligible and often
recurring a phrase (e. g. Cic. de leg. I 17, 47 teneros et rudes II 15 38 animi
teneri et molles Quint. I 11, 2 teneram . . . et rudem Sen. Ep. 50, 4 teneri
et rudes animi) is conceivable. The rare figurative use of ‘ virides,’ on the
other hand, naturally gave rise to an interlinear gloss, which, on finding its
way into the text, caused the corruption of ‘virides ' in some of our MSS.
So in Ov. Trist. IV 10, 5 frater ad eloquium viridi tendebat ab aevo, one
MS. (λ) actually reads tenero l The original reading is, therefore, either ιν.

et teneri' or ‘v. et rudes.’ I prefer the former as being better suited to
⁴ imbuuntur. '

5 in tota domo: Woelfflin, Plzilol. XXVII 126 observes that the
addition of the preposition in these and similar expressions is
characteristic of the earlier or Ciceronian period of Tacitean style.
It is, however, possible that the ‘in' in our passage is due to a
dittography of the preceding ‘ms —pensi habet: Pensi habere up
to the time of Symmachus (e. g. Ep. I 73) is always used with a
negative. The omission of a neuter pronoun is an innovation of
Valerius Maximus e. g. II 9, 3 nec pensi duxerat. Cp. Thielmann,
Archiv II 387 ff. -The phrase itself seems to have been proverbial.
Cf. Sall. Cat. 23, 2 prorsus neque dicere neque facere quicquam
pensi habebat Liv. XXVI 15, 4 sed illis nec quid dicerent nec quid
facerent quicquam umquam pensi fuissent XLIII 7 quibus nihil
neque dicere pensi neque facere. ‘Pensi habere' occurs in two
