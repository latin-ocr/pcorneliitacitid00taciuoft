c, 20. 221

Seu. Ep. 114, 3 illo (sc. animo) vitiato. Finally, both words are found
grouped together also in Cic. pro Sest. 54, 115 comitiorum et contionum
significationes sunt nonnumquam vitiatae atque corruptae. The alliteration
observable in ‘cursu . . . colore . . . cultu' is so evidently intended to
mark off the various elements of the enumeration‚ that ⁶ nitore,' which
destroys the stylistic equilibrium, may be justly objected to. . It is probably
a mere marginal or interlinear gloss, suggested by c. 23 22, which subse-
quently found its way into the text. Cp. the very similar alliterative collo-
cation c. 26 8 lascivia . . . levitate . . . licentia and note c. 36 18.

8. aversatur is’used absolutely also in Plaut. Trin. 629 noli
aversari Cic. Cluent. 63, 177 aversari advocati et iam vix ferre
posse Verr. II 2, 76, 187 haerere homo, aversari (versari, Jordan)
rubere.

Dicentem is undoubtedly a superfluous addition, as is also clear from its
unwarranted emphatic position, but to attribute the marginal gloss (as John
does) to some ancient reader who had observed that ‘aversari' is used
transitively elsewhere in Tacitus, would imply an incredibly profound
knowledge of Tacitean usage on the part of this interpolator, the passages
being widely scattered in the Histories and Annals.

Vulgus - · · adsistentium et adfluens et vagus auditor: The general
lay public which is drawn to the court by an idle curiosity, is
elsewhere in the Dialogus distinguished from the ‘auditores'
who are assiduous attendants at trials ‘ profectus sui causa' (c. 34
5 ff). Cf. c. 23 11 non auditores sequuntur, non populus audit
32 7 non doctus modo et prudens auditor sed etiam populus intel-
legit. These passages are sufficient to show that the ‘adfluens
et vagus auditor' is not identical with the ‘auditor' mentioned
in later chapters but, as the epithets clearly indicate, the second
clause merely singles out one particular clement in this miscel-
laneous audience. Cf. note c. 9 1. -adfluens et vagus: i. e. chance
or casual listeners who happen to flock in, passing in and out at
intervals. In this sense ‘adfluens' is poetic andin prose not earlier
than Livy, but quite common in Tacitus. Cf. Verg. Aen. II 796
Liv. XXXV 31 adfluente cotidie multitudine Tac. Ag. 29 H. Ι
36 IV 25 Ann. ΙΙ 76 IV 62 VI 36 XIV 8. In Cicero, it is a
synonym of ‘diveS,abundanS.' —exigere laetitiam: The best com-
mentary for the following passage is the 114th Epistle of Seneca.
See notes below.—Although ‘laetuS,' signifying an ornate style,
is extremely common, the abstract noun laetitia in the same sense
seems to occur only here. Cf. note c. 21 16.
