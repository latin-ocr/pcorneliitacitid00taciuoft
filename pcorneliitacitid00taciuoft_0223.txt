8 mihi=a me. The so-called dativus subiectivus is far more
common in Tac. than one would suppose from Nipperdey's note to
Ann. II 50, for it occurs more than thirty times. D. 32 30 Ag. 2

off. III 9 de inv. Ι 86 de fin. I 4, 11, where see Madvig. Not
found in Caesar, Velleius and Curtius, but quite frequent in Seneca,
Pliny and Quint. Cp. Dr. H. S. 1 428-31, Stil ἓ 51.

9 satis superque sudatum: On the alliteration, cf. note to c. 2 13
and Proleg. p. cxvii.

10 eloquentiam colam solam: Cf. Cic. Orat. 7, 23 ad eam quam
sentiam eloquentiam. Brut. 90, 309 illam iustam eloquentiam quam
dialecticam dilatatam. Many similar instances of ὁμοιοτέλευτα and
ὁμοιόπτωτα (cf. Cic. de orat. III 54, 206) in Tac. have been col-
lected by Nipp. Ann. I 24. 59 and Weinkauff p. 77. See Proleg.
p. cxvii. For Cicero, cp. Seyffi-Mull. Laelius p. 189 and esp. Ellendt
de orat. III 6, 22 and in general R. V. III 865 note 619, and
Volkmann Rhet. p. 483. The Roman ear took no offence at an
accumulation of ‘a' sounds3 in the present instance, the alleged
cacophony is, moreover, considerably lessened by difference of
quantity. So Ann. I 24 ignis patulis magis urbis locis. ³ Sanctus

et augustus' is a favorite collocation of Cicero e. g. de nat. deor.
I 42, 119 II 24, 62 III 21, 53 Tusc. Disp. V 13, 37.

solam inserted by Vahlen gives additional weight to the solemn assevera-
tion of Maternus. The word was omitted as a dittography of colam.
