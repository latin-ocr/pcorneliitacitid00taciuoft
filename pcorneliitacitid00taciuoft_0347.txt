The passages just cited, and the remarkable general agreement between

” Tacitus and Quintilian, pointing unmistakably to a common source, ought

to leave no doubt that ‘ exsanguem et aridum ' represents the genuine read-
ing. The examples usually adduced from Quintilian in support of ⁶ attritus‚’
e. g. X 1, 27 attrita cotidiano actu forensi ingenia 4, 4 sit ergo aliquando
quod placeat . . . ut opus poliat, non exterat, seem to have little, if any-
thing, in common with the passage under notice, and are in any case not
sufficient to offset the convincing evidence in favor of the repeatedly-occur-
ring collocation 111 the text. Cp. also Peter ad 100.

Peterson, to Quint. X 1, 27, renders the word in both passages by

is used in particular reference, it would seem, to the philosophie
discursiveness of Brutus, while in c. 22 it pertains to Cicero’s lack
