difficulties on the other exclude the possibility of Tacitean author-
ship. It will be expedient to take up the latter objection first, but
to answer it successfully, it will be necessary above all to ascertain,
11 possible, the dramatic date of the Dialogue and the date 01
publication.¹‘³

P.2⁰ Cornelius Tacitus was probably born not earlier than 54 and
not later than 56 A. D.²¹

Now in c. 17 10 ff.‚ Aper, the champion 01 the modern style 01
eloquence, in order to prove the purely relative meaning of the
term ‘ antiqui' and the consequent injustice of its persistent appli-
cation to the orators of the Roman Republic, draws the attention
01 his hearers to the fact that the interval that has elapsed between
the death of Cicero and the present day does not exceed the limit
of a man's life-time. To substantiate this assertion he gives an
annalistic enumeration 01 the reigns of the Roman emperors from
Augustus down 'to Vespasian. (Statue sex et quinquaginta annos
“ quibus mox divus Augustus rem publicam rexit . . . ac sextam iam
felicis huius principatus stationem ²2 quo Vespasianus rem publicam

1⁹ Some critics, like Lange and Urlichs 101 instance, 111 order to avoid certain
obJ‘ections to which they attached undue weight‚ suggested that possibly a long
interval had elapsed between the composition and the publication 01 1116 treatise.
But this hypothesis is worthless and uncalled 101· ; worthless, because it involves
the gratuitous assumption that Tacitus was prevented from publishing the
treatise in the reign 01 Titus, and 11 so, that he issued this work 01 his youth in
the reign 01 Trajan, when wholly occupied with historical composition. It is
uncalled 101, because the difficulties which gave it birth, do not exist, as we
shall see.

2³ The praenomen Publius, given by the cod. Mediceus, has been recently
confirmed by a Carian inscription (Bull. de Corresp. Hell. 1890 p. 621) Ἀσιανοὶ
Ἴωνες Ἀνθυ[πάτῳ] Πο. Κορν[ηλίῳ] Τακίτῳ. Apoll. Sidon. Ep. IV 14. 22 calls him
twice Gaius, but the C„ found also in a few MSS„ was probably originally due
to a dittography 01 1116 11111161 letter 01 1116 110111611 gentile.

21 In the famous and much disputed passage at the beginning 01 1116 Histories
(Ι 1) z dignitatem nostram a Vespasiano (69-79) incohatam, a Tito (79-81)
auctam, a Domitiano (81-96) longius provectam non abnuerim, diym'tatem . . .
auctam is the technical designation 101 1116 quaestorship (Borghesi,Urlichs)‚ and
11 Tacitus was appointed to this office by Titus ⁶ suo anno,' he was twenty-five
years old and therefore born 54, 55 or 56. In the present discussion, it will be
expedient to assume the earliest date with Nipperdey, for by making this con-
cession the chronological objections will be emphasised as strongly as possible,
and their subsequent refutation accordingly the more convincing.

The peculiar meaning which the word has here, is perhaps a Gallicism.
