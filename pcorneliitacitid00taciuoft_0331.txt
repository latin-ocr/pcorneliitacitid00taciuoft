13 longum et unum: The reigns of these three emperors exceeded
one year but lasted less than two (June 6. 68 —Dec. 20. 69), hence
styled ‘that one memorably long year'3 memorable, because so
many stirring events occurred within 80 short a period. Observe
that ‘unus' in Tac. does not precede, except when joined to a
numeral, so always in the phrase ‘unus . . . alter,' or to ‘idem’
(e. g. c. 22 26 G. 24). Cf. 0. 34 31 with note and 41 16.

14 stationem: '‘sixth year of the reign of Vespasian! In this

ll. cc. No valid reason, however, has been or can be adduced
against the admissibility of this interpretation, for it alone brings
out the intended meaning of the passage without arbitrary altera-
tions of the text. The Dialogus—and Aper’s speeches in par-
ticular—furnish numerous instances of words used in peculiar
significations. Cf. e. g. c. 9 28 genium propitiare 12 9 sanguinans
13 1 contubernium 17 29 adgnoscere 18 12 elaboratus (of persons)
19 10 spatia 19 15 odoratus 20 cortina 28 15 educabatur 31 22 col-
lectum genus dicendi. “ ,

24 ext. Ag. 30 H. I 30 IV 64 Ann. XII 42. The interpretation
of Andresen and others ² down to this very day' is based upon the
assumption, discussed at length in a previous note, that ‘ centum et
viginti' represents the exact sum total of a preceding enumera-
tion, but this implies an error which has been shown not to exist,
and compels us to place the debate in the year 77, a date rendered
impossible by c. 37 7, where see note. Cp. also Proleg. xxiv n. 23.

17 ipse ego: qu is made purposely emphatic by position, in
order to add strong confirmation to what might seem an exag—
gerated statement. In c. 15 17, 811011 emphasis would have been of
too direct and personal a nature, hence ‘ vos ipsi.² On the position
of ¹ ipsi,' when joined to the oblique cases of the personal pronoun,
866 note c. 3 12.—iateretur: Usually explained as a consecutive
subj. ³ so old was he that he was able to say,' but is perhaps better
taken as a subj. of characteristic. -On the alleged longevity

—The invasions of Britain by Julius Caesar took place in 55
and 54 Β. 0. ‘ Arcere litoribus' and Caesar's own narrative (B. G.
IV 20-36 V 4-23) leave no doubt that the earlier of these is
here meant—Britanniae· · · adgressi sunt: The subject ² Britanni'
