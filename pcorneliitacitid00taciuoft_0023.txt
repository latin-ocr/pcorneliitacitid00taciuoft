PROLEGOMENA. xxi

serious obstacle to those who denied the genuineness of the
¹ Dialogus, and accordingly we are not surprised to find that Lipsius
was bent upon impugning the validity of the evidence itself, his
contention being that the name might have been added to the
treatise,handed down to us ἀδέσποτον, by accident or design. When
J it became known that a far greater number of MSS. of the Dialogus
” existed than Lipsius had supposed, it was claimed that his inference
” still held good, inasmuch as these MSS. were not so many inde-

pendent witnesses but were all ultimately derived from a sinqle
Τ copy, not older than the middle of the XIII. century.¹⁵ Taking this

· very questionable fact in connection with the observation (1) that
the Dialogus invariably occupies the last place in a codex miscel-

.··· laneus containing also the Suetonius fragment and Tacitus'
Germania, Hess and Haase confidently argued that the presumably

anonymous treatise owed the name of Tacitus to the Germania

f immediately preceding it.16 Unfortunately, the order of the three

treatises in our MSS. irrefutably disproves this very premise1⁷ and
’ with it the inference based upon it, for the Germania precedes the

Π s scholars such as Sabellicus and Peutinger and editor of Terence, Sallust, Varro,

Livy, Pliny the Younger, and Quintilian, quoted a passage from the Dialogus of
Tacitus (c. 26 3). This seemed such strong testimony in favor of the historian
that Lipsius, as we have seen, wishing to get rid of this awkward evidence at all

hazards‚ stultified himself by accusing Sabinus, whom he styles iynobilis gram-

maticus, of forging the citationi Gutmann reiterated the same absurd charge

it: and Fr. Hess p. 16 actually censured the learned Italian for attributing the phrase

 

‘calamistros Maecenatis' to Tacitus, whereas it is in reality used by Messalla 1
The citation of course proves nothing except the well-known fact that no sus-
picion was entertained regarding the Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus before
the time of Rhenanus. Sabinus may easily have obtained his information from
some of the printed editions published during his life-time or even from some

MS. He is known to have copied the Agricola with his own hand. Cp.

genere servatus esse videtur, nisi in quo is Germaniae Taciti subiunctus esset, ut
facile potuerit, id quod saepissime factum est, auctoris nomen recte in antece-
dente libro positum ad alium librum transferri qui in eodem volumine illum
