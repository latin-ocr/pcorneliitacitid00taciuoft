the entire historical works (105-115 A. n.) furnish scarcely more
’ῑ-ῥ, 1311611 50 genuine instances in all, the proportion being about 2 : 1 in
'³' = favor of the Histories, some particular groupings, however, occur—
ring repeatedly, e. g. discordia, turbae, dissensio ; fama, laus, gloria,
.· nomen3 quies, pax, otium3 vires, arma, manus3 inauditus, inde-
ff sensus. The great majority of instances are met with also in the
⁵ ’ minor writings, but the following collocations in the Dialogus are
2 exactly paralleled only in the Agricola and Germania: metum ac
3 terrorem (c. 5 22 Ag. 32), tueri et defendere (c. 7 8 G. 14), nemora et
4 J . lucos (c. 9 32 12 1 G. 9. 10. 45), fortuitae et subitae (c. 10 31 G. 11),
g yloria . . . honor (c. 12 14 G. 5), inqenium ac studium (c. 14 10 Ag. 3),
ζ’ caeli siderumque (c. 16 29 Ag. 12), vi et potestate (c. 19 23 G. 42),
vim et ardorem (c. 24 2 Ag. 8), severitate ac disciplina (c. 28 11
G. 25), remissiones lususque (c. 28 20 Ag. 3), probitati neque modestiae
(c. 29 7 40 G. 36), anqustis et brevibus (c. 30 27 G. 6), consilio et
auctoritate (c. 36 22 G. 12), quies . . . otium (c. 38 17 Ag. 6. 21. 42).
j Only about a dozen, finally, apparently lack an exact or analogous

¹ Ι, Lastly, attention may be drawn to the extensive use made of the Oratio
’“ so-called oratio bimembris and trimembris, which consists in the amplfflcata·
⁸· more or less redundant amplification‘ of a thought and evidently
. serves the purpose of establishing a stylistic equilibrium or rhetor-
ical libration of clauses. Weinkauff (pp. 89-97) has with great
³ χ industry, though an excessive zeal, collected 315 (1) alleged instances
of this usage from the writings of Tacitus. Unfortunately, by far
the greater number, especially in the case of those given under
oratio bimembris, exhibits no feature that might not be readily
paralleled e. g. from Cicero, Livy, and Pliny. They are, therefore,
quite valueless for purposes of comparison of the usage of the
Dialogus and the other writings of Tacitus. Nevertheless, there
remain not a few illustrations which, by reason of a peculiarity of
collocation, are not without some significance in the present discus· “
sion. E. g.

η a. The amplifyinq clause is preceded by a parenthetical phrase:
