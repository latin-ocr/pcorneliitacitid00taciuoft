the learned were stirred by the dispute regarding nominalism and
³ realism. The France οξ the 17 th century is deeply agitated by the

momentous question touching the superiority of the wisdom οξ the

ancients over that οξ the moderns. The war, as often, ended in
a compromise. Perrault on his death-bed became reconciled to
Boileau. The same quarrel had been transplanted to England by
St. Evremond3 it is represented by Sir Wm. Temple, Wm. Wotton
ζ· (“Β,οΗοο1;ἰοῃε on Ancient and Medern Learning'), Dryden (Preface
· to his translation οξ the Aeneid), Boyle and Bentley, Swift (Tale
of the Tub and the Battle οξ the Books). There is scarcely a con-
:³ temporary English writer οξ repute who was not drawn into the

fray as a partisan. Then suddenly we hear no more οξ the dispute3

Ji, it had ceased to exist. In France, in the 18th century, another
²³„ very similar controversy arose in regard to the decline in taste and

the superiority οξ Homer as an epic poet. The works οξ Regnier,

⁰ Fenelon, Hardouin, Aubignac, Terrason, Buffon, etc„ etc., all resound
² with the discussion οξ this pseudo-momentous issue. Finally, on

Ζ ’ April 5, 1716, Mad. Dacier and La Motte signed the articles οξ
“ peace, and the latter announced in an alleged poem to a breathlessly
expectant Academy, that the war was, indeed, ended, the victory

ἵ being, as usual, on neither side.4⁰

Now the controversy concerning the decline οξ eloquence, 1 con-
tend, belongs to the same category οξ burning issues as those just
enumerated. The identical question was discussed in the days οξ ’
Demetrius Phalereus and, in Latin literature, esp. from the 4th—7th
decade οξ the first century, references to the same topic meet us

ι at every turn. Cp. e. g. Petronius in the very first chapter, Seneca

in his Introduction to the Controversiae, the younger Seneca in his

Epistles‚ and the anonymous author οξ Περὶ ὕψους in the famous

 

closing chapter. In the reign οξ Domitian these voices are hushed.
The controversy had, as in all the instances cited, passed off the
stage. The very existence οξ Quintilian⁷s Institutio Oratoria bears
eloquent testimony to this fact. He does, indeed, preach a return
to the classic model οξ Cicero to counteract the pernicious influence
οξ the emasculated though scintillating style οξ Seneca, so popular
at the time οξ his arrival in Rome. But when he wrote his great
work, a more hopeful, optimistic feeling had taken possession of
