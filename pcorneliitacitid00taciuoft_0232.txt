fluouS. — potenti} ao potestate: Potentia (δύναμις) designates power

as such, potestas (ἐξουσία) the power to exercise authority by virtue
of some office, but this difference is not invariably observed. Cp.
Tegge, Stud. z. labain. Synonymik„ Berlin 1886 p. 272 Heraeus ad
H. I 1, 1. Schmidt, Handb. d. Syn. p. 360 unsuccessfully en-
deavors to establish a metaphysical distinction. -On the allitera-
tion, see Proleg. p. cxvii.

24 rebus prospere fluentibus: Cf. Ann. XV 5 nec praesentia pro-
spere fluebant Cic. de off. I 26, 90 in rebus prosperis . . fluentibus.

Sall. Fragm. 70 rebus supra vota fluentibus (imitated by Tac. H.
IV 48 Iust. 23, 3).

25 aliorum: Subjective genit. with perfugio, objective with 'tu-s

tela. —³vis et utilitas ' belong closely together ² beneficent power‚'
as is shown by the sing. predicate. Ι

26 increpuit: Danger is supposed to emit a noise of warning as
it approaches. A bold figure and not quite paralleled by the pas-
sages usually quoted from Cic. Cat. Ι 7, 18 quidquid increpuerit
Catilinam timeri. pro Mur. 10, 22 81111111 atque increpuit suspicio
tumultus and Livy IV 43 VI 37 XLIV 41. The perf. ind. (cod. D
increpuerit) like G. 10. 39 H. II 76 Α1111. IV 33. Cp. Klintberg,
p. 27.

27 reo et periclitanti=reo in periculo eloquentia )( lorica et
gladius [militi] in acie. The adjective ‘periclitanti' is, therefore,
not a superfluous addition but is necessary to bring out the anti-
thesis. Translate: ‘ To the accused in a court of law.' Andresen
regarding the expression as tautological, as do the rest of commen-
tators, says that we expect * 111 foro‚⁷ but that this is not the intended
contrast to ‘in acie‚⁷ is clearly shown by the words ‘sive in iudicio . .
in senatu . . apud principem.'

Vahlen's very simple emendation [quae est] praesidium admirably re-
stores the force and symmetry of the simile which, if not destroyed, is
decidedly weakened by the addition of praesidium . . telum, as a mere
apposition of eloquentia.

28 pariter et: The classical Qpariter ac' also occurs a few times in
Tacitus e. g. 0. 39 15 Ag. 11 G. 19 H. IV 73 Α1111. IV 50. See also
note 0. 5 14. -— sive · · vel · . sive: On the use of ‘sive'ss see the
exhaustive treatise of C. F. W. Muller‚ Progr. Ioachimsthal. Gymn.
Berlin 1871 and note to 0. 4 6.

The MSS. read vel-sive-sive‚ an unparalleled correlation. The suggestion
of Muretus, so generally accepted, leaves the origin of the corruption un-
