PROLEGOMENA. lxxxv

ἶ fragment. If s0, he argueS, we can ascertain with mathematical
accuracy the size· of the page of the archetypon by a simple com-
parison with the known extent of the omissions in Pliny's letters,
³23 these lacunae not being found in all MSS. of Pliny. Habbe thus
calculates the gap in the Dialogus at one-seventh of the entire
treatise.¹⁷² With those who, like myself, are unable to attach any
argumentative validity to his premises, the result reached by means
of them will not carry conviction, and I ain inclined to think that
Ι, 110 satisfactory answer can be given to the question under notice
⁷ without the accession of new MS. material.

In the determination of the contents of the lacuna, scholars were
of course influenced by the views which they held regarding the
degree of prominence given by-the author to Secundus. Those who
maintained* that he did not speak at all were unable to invent any-
¹thing else that might have been spoken by Maternus3 of others

j who believed that Secundus' entire speech was lost in the lacuna,
only Brotier has ventured to reconstruct in detail the topics dis-

  

cussed in the missing portioris, His restoration, though written in
fluent Latin, would scarcely deserve mention, save as a jeu d'esprit,
γ (11(1 not Habbe, after giving a short synopsis of it (p. 10 f.)‚ express
his conviction that this supplement is in every way worthy of being
rescued from oblivion. ‘Atque Broterium,’ he continues, ‘melius
meritum esse puto de aureolo illo libello recte percipiendo quam
nonnullos illorum . . . partis amissae imaginem non multum a

Ἰ veritate abhorrentem ante oculos legentium exposuit.' ¹⁷⁸
ἵ · Τ1113 favorable comment is, in my judgment, a deplorable aberra-
’ tion, for Brotier's supplement is based upon a complete misunder-
standing, not only of the scope and the plan of the Dialogue, but
’ 3130 of the attitude and the character of the interlocutors. The
. utterances put into the mouth of Messalla, of Secundus (sim long
chapters are devoted to him) and of Maternus are a kind of con-
, glomeration or potpourri of criticisms, anecdotes and the like,
culled from Seneca Rhetor, Velleius, Seneca the philosopher,

¹⁷² 1 append the conclusion (p. 10):
‘⁴2 chartae = 4 pag. cod. archet. = fere ἐς 00(1. Μο(1. 47, 36 (Pliny).

Dialogi autem quod reliquum est ad hunc codicem Mediceum ut 1 ad 6. Ergo
pars Dialogi amissa = ἦ = 2¹7”! Q. E. D.

¹⁷⁸ The same favorable view is taken by Krauss, who incorporated the
Broterian supplement into his German translation, Stuttgart 1882.
