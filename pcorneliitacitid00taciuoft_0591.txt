COMMENTS ΟΝ FIRST EDITION.

Prof- Η. Τ. Peck‚ in Educational Review (November, 1893, pp. 401-403) ; Dr. Gudeman
has performed his work with excellent judgment, ripe scholarship, and a nice appreciation of
the needs of classical students, and has done not a little to lighten the labors of lecturers
and other university teachers in giving them so complete and well-digested a synopsis. The
bibliographical references, including as they do the very latest and best works of recent
scholarship, would alone make it worthy of the high place it has already won in the favor of
classical instructors.

Dr. B. Ktibler, in Deutsche Literaturzeitung (No. 27, 1893): Die Auswahl ist im
Allgemeinen geschickt gemacht. . . . Das practisch angelegte Biichlein dari seines Erfolges
sicher sein.

TACITUS, DIALOGUS DE ORAToRlssUS. Edited‚ with Intro·
duction and Notes‚ by CHARLES E. BENNETT‚ Professor of tlte
Latin Language and Literature in Cornell University.

IN COLLEGE SERIES OF LA TIN AUTHORS.

Owing to the lack of an annotated English edition, the Dialogus of Tacitus
has hitherto been practically inaccessible to the students of American and English
colleges. In foreign schools the work has long been highly prized, and it is well
worthy of a place in our own higher education.

Great pains have been taken in this edition to incorporate the results of the
most recent textual and exegetical studies on the Dialogus. Special attention has
been paid to the language in its relations to prae-Augustan standards on the one
hand and to Tacitus's later works on the other. An introduction treats of the
disputed authorship of the work, of the interlocutors‚ the language and style, the
date of composition, and the course of thought. A critical appendix and indexes
accompany the volume.
