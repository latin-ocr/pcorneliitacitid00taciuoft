tant part in the Thyestes of MaternuS‚ the tragedy cannot have
dealt exclusively -with the celebrated cena Thyestea, but must
have also included the later phase of the story in which Aga-
memnon and Menelaus, now grown to man's estate, capture Thy-
estes at Delphi, whence he is brought back to Argos and thrown
into prison3 Aegisthus sent-in to murder the prisoner is recog-
nised by him as his own son. There follows the suicide of Aerope
and the subsequent assassination ¹of Atreus while sacrificing at the
altar. Cf. Hygin. Fab. 88. This story certainly offered ample
opportunities for the eloquent harangues of Agamemnon unmistak-
ably alluded to by Aper. It was dramatised by Euripides in the
Θυέστης, by Sophocles probably in the Θ. δεύτερος and perhaps also
by Accius in the Pelopidae. —In like manner, the Atreus of Scau-
rus contained covert attacks upon the emperor Tiberius. Cf. Tac.
Ann. VI 29: nihil hunc (sc. Scaurum) amicitia Seiani sed labefecit
haud minus validum ad exitia Macronis odium qui easdem artes
occultius exercebat detuleratque argumentum tragoediae a Scauro
scriptae additis versibus qui in Tiberium flecterentur. Dio Cass.
58, 24 Ἀτρεὺς μὲν τὸ ποίημα ἦν παρῄνει δὲ τῶν ἀρχομένων τινὶ ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ
κατὰ τὸν Ἐυριπίδην ἶνα τὴν τοῦ κρατοῦντος ἀβουλίαν φέρῃ (Phoen. 396)
τὰς τῶν κρατούντων ἀμαθίας φέρειν χρεών. By Way Of eontrasb With
the behaviour of Maternus, we may compare the story related by
Sen. Contr. 10 praef. 8 of Τ. Labienus: memini aliquando, cum
recitaret historiam, magnam partem illum libri convolvisse et dixisse
² haec quae transeo post mortem meam legentur!

vam IV 40 ipse quid intra animum volutaverim Quint. XI 3, 2
quae intra nosmet ipsos composuimus, ——ipsez Tacitus invariably ¹
places ipse in the nominative when joined to an oblique case of
the personal or possessive pronoun. Cf. c. 3 20 tibi ipse . . impor-
tasses 7 1 de me ipse fatear 15 7 ipse tibi denegares 12 mecum

postpositivc with but one apparent exception in c. 15 7, where
see note. On this much discussed idiom, cp. Nagelsbach, Stilist.
