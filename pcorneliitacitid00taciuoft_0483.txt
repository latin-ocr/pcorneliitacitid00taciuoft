The same collocation is common in Cic. e. g. pro Caec. 18, 52 but
not found in Quintilian.

23 qui quin immo sibi ipsi persuaserant: The speaker passes
on from the political honors which eloquence secured or facilitated
to a consideration of its indispensability in all the walks of life.—
On the anastrophe of the conjunction, cf. note c. 6 7.

With the reading ‘quin immo sibi persuaserant’ (so B), this conviction
would be predicated of the ancients generally, thus involving another
change of subJ'ect, which, though common enough, is here rendered im-
probable by the following explanatory clauses: nec mirum etc. cum etiam
inviti . . . producerentur etc. It seems to me far more suitable to the con-
text to say, that those who aspired to a conspicuous position in the com-
monwealth‚ had the conviction forced upon them, that it was only by
means of eloquence that they could hope to satisfy their ambition. This
meaning is secured by retaining ‘ipsi ⁹ and reading ⁴ qui quin,⁷ an ingenious
emendation of John (Fleck. Jahrb. 1888 p. 576) which he has unjustly, I
think, abandoned in his note ad loc. Perhaps the unintelligible reading of
C ‘ quidem qui' (1. 22) owes its existence to a misplacement of the ‘qui’
before ‘ quin.’

25 nee mirum: on the ellipsis of the copula, usual with this
phrase, cf. note c. 19 17.

26 cum parum esset - · · nisi qui: The‘use of a negative con-
ditional sentence after negative expressions like ‘parum est' and
the like, where the strictly logical sequence of thought would
rather require an adversative coordinate clause, is peculiarly idio-
matic. Cf. Plaut. Trin. 249 non satis id mali ni etiam amplius quod
