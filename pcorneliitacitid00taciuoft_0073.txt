PRoLEcoMENA, lxxi

’Ῑ by Cassius Severus and Seneca, and he vehemently protests against
the disparagement of contemporary rhetoric at the expense of the
Ᾰ ancient type of eloquence, which he regards as no longer suited to
s the demands made upon modern orators by the altered taste and
-’ the higher euitare of his time.

In giving a characteristic tone to Aper⁷s diction, the author dis-
'³ plays greater skill than in the stylistic individualisation of the
² other interlocutors. It is typified by redundancy of expression, a
‚ fondness for metaphorS, often singular and bold, and an occasionally
¹ ’ peculiar vocabulary, all of which features are far less conspicuous,
s if not wholly absent, in the speeches of MaternUS, Messalla or
f Secundus.¹4⁸ How far Aper's style is a faithful reproduction of
the original, can, of course, not be determined. The fact, however,
that the man himself, drawn to the life as he seems, has been
invested with some touches which were unquestionably copied from
Cicero's portrayal of Antonius in the de oratore, suggests the prob-
ability that Aper's speeches, with their numerous Ciceronian remi-
, niscences in thought and phraseology, are also from the formal side
an artistic production of the author, the really historical elements,
if such exist at all, being exceedingly few in number.

JULIUS SECUNDUS is far better known to us, for Quintilian Julius

by Ο. Hirschfeld with the Σεκοῦνδος ὁ ῥήτωρ (i. e. the well-known

14³ Some of these features, from a mistaken notion of the purpose for which
they are designed‚ have been severely censured and used as an argument
against the Tacitean authorship of the Dialogue‚ but, as Weinkauff (p. cxxxv)
has well observed, emphatic reiteration‚ while possibly objectionable to a reader,
is in itself not ill-suited to a spoken speech which pur-ports to represent an actual
improvisation.
