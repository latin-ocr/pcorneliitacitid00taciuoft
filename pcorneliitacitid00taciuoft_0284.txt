9 111 Neronem etc. : The evident desire for succinctness and
clearness is responsible for the peculiar ‘collocatio verborum'
noticeable in this phrase, a conciseness inimitable in English. The
construction itself is supported by numerous parallels. Cf. 6. g.

cessarily supposes an ellipsis of ‘ exercitam.' Translate ι ‘I crushed
'Vatinius’ baneful power over Nero, by which even the sanctity of
literature was violated.'

The acc. Neronem, which gives a perfectly satisfactory sense, has been
uniformly reJected by editors, with the exception of Baehrens. See p. 13.
But the ablative cannot under any circumstances be regarded as the original,
for no conceivable reasons can ever have prompted a scribe deliberately to
alter ‘Nerone ⁹ into ‘ Neronem.' On the other hand the ablative is easily
explained by the accidental omission of the dash over the 6. The persistent
refusal 01 critics to accept ⁶ Neronem ' becomes the more surprising when
it is observed that every other reading involves us in insuperable difficul-
ties. ⁶ Imperante Nerone‚' which has met with great favor, is, in my judg-
ment, quite out of place, for the chronological information thus imparted
is wholly gratuitous. Every one of Maternus’ hearers must have been per-
fectly familiar with the celebrated achievement alluded to. ‘ In Nerone '
could only refer to a praetextata composed by Maternus in Nero's time,
but this is necessarily based upon the assumption that the poet began his
career as a dramatist with praetextatae, an assumption intrinsically im-
probable and flatly contradicted by 6. 3 eX. Under these circumstances,
the imaginat-ive reconstruction of 1116 plot of ‘ Nero ⁹ as given by Peter, no

with the Domitius (c. 3), may be fitly passed by as unworthy of serious
attention. We must be content with learning that Maternus achieved this
signal success by some drama in which Vatinius was covertly though unmis-
