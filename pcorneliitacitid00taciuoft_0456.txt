Ch. 33-36. Maternus draws attention to the manifest incomplete-
ness of Messalla's treatment of the subject, and requests him to supple-
ment it by yivinq also an account of the manner in which the youth
of the period, after completin9 their theoretical seducation, acquired a
thorouyh practical traininq, a requirement equally essential to a suc-
cessful oratorical career (-— c. 33 12). Messalla complies by showing
that such forensic experience was qained by constant personal attend-
ance in the law-courts themselves and by actual association with the

instructive method is thereupon contrasted with the modern pernicious
practice of moot-courts, conducted within the walls of the school-rooms
of qoodfor-notlt‘lnq rhetoricians and dealinq with stetit-icus, qrotesque ν
and far-fetched themes. Thus brouqht up in a purely artfficial
atmosphere, the youth of the day are helpless, when called upon
to take part in real forensic or judicial encounters (— c. 35). The
close of the speech is lost.

Quint. VI 4, 1 altercationis praecepta poterant videri tunc inco·
handa cum omnia . . . peregissem. ’

3 vestigia ac liniamenta: A double metaphor. Vestiqia occurs ἴ .
a number of times in a figurative sense in Tacitus e. g. Ag. 16 ¹ Ἰ
quorum vestigiis et studiis vitam duxerit 2 patris . . . vestigia
premere, but ‘ liniamenta,' though common in Cicero (Orat. 56, 186
Brut. 87, 298), is used in but one other passage in Tac. and then in
its regular meaning of ‘outlinesss Gn 16 picturam et liniamenta
colorum imitetur. —Peter well observes that ² ostendisse' in place
of ‘tradidisse' still further emphasises the incompleteness of
Messalla's previous exposition. Cf. Ag. 13 divus Iulius . . . potest
videri ostendisse posteris non tradidisse (sc. Britanniam).—On
the repetition ‘ videris . . . videaris.' See note c. 1 8.
