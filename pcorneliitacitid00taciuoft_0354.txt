Hermagorae: Hermayoras of Temnos, very frequently con-
, founded by scholars e. g. Andresen and Wolff, with his far less
illustrious namesake, the follower of Theodorus of Gadara and
contemporary of Augustus, flourished about 160 B. 0. and was the
founder of a new system of rhetoric in opposition to the Peripatetic
and Stoic doctrines then in vogue. It dealt chiefly, if not exclu-
sively, with εὕρεσις, inventio. As SandyS, Orat. Introd. p. xxxvn
well remarks, ³ the very fact that it was confined to the considera-
tion of subject matter, which is independent of questions of language,
while it neglected the department of style in which it would have
naturally limited itself to Greek alone, made the teaching of Her-
magoras readily available for use by Roman studentS.' See also
Wilkins, de orat. Introd. p. 46 f. The Rhet. ad Her. and Cicero's
de inventione seem to be based upon his work, entitled τέχναι
ῥητορικαί (in 7 bks.). Its dry character, owing to an over-subtle
ingennity of analysis, is also attested by Quint. III 11, 21 f. haec
(sc. Hermagorae) affectata subtilitas circa nomina rerum ambitiose
laborat . . . non est necesse per tam minutas rerum particulas ratio-
nem docendi concidere quo vitio multi quidem laborarunt, prae-
cipue tamen Hermagoras, vir alioqui subtilis et in plurimis admi-
randus sqq. Cp. the exhaustive treatment of Susemihl, Gesclz. d.
