This is the reading proposed by Gronovius on the basis of a passage
111 Cic. Brut. 69, 242, in which one Q. Arrius, in spite of his
oratorical mediocrity, is dealt with at some length, which draws
from Atticus the impatient remark ‘tu quidem de faece hauris!
He was praetor in 72 B. 0. 01111 was appointed to succeed Verres,
but remained in Italy 011 0000111113 01 1110 slave war in which he took
a prominent part. He is probably the same individual mentioned
by Plut. Cic. 15 Κόϊντος ”Αρριος, ἀνὴρ στρατηγικός. He WaS defeated

novius with an orator 01 11101 1101110 111 Cic. ad 10111. Χ, 25. 26 011 Α113.

111010 were two Furnii, father and son, both distinguished orators.
The father, a friend of Cicero and opponent 01 Antony, is frequently
¹ referred 10 111 Cicero's correspondence and elsewhere, and is very
probably 1110 person alluded 10 by Aper. His eloquence, in striking
contrast to the low opinion expressed 01 him here, is extravagantly
eulogised in a passage 01 Ρ1111. Ant. 58 Φουρνίου δὲ λέγοντος, ὃς ἦν

frequently illustrated by metaphors taken from the human body,
particularly its arms, sinews, muscleS, boneS, flesh and blood. Cp.
