Of the numerous interpretations to which this passage has been subJ'ected,
such as are entirely or partially based upon objections against the phrase
‘fatalis et meus dies’ may be, I think, dismissed as groundless on the
strength of the many passages just cited. The others naturally group
themselves under two heads‚ according to the interpretation of ‘quan-
doque' in the sense of ‘aliquando’ (Halm, Peter, Andresen, Wiesler),
or in that of ‘quandocunque' (Ritter, John, Wolff). Both parties agree
in reading ‘statuarque’ According to the first-mentioned view, the
entire phrase is a parenthetical remark, containing the sanguine assurance
of the speaker that he will not meet with the violent death which Aper
is alleged to have predicted for him (c. 10 ext.), if he persisted in pro-
voking his powerful superiors by too outspoken poetical productions.
To this, it may be replied z (1) That such a statement is wholly out of place
in a parenthesis, and not properly introduced by ‘ enim,' which Peter and
Andresen retain, for there is no causal connection between ‘nec plus
habeam' and ‘quandoque—veniet) See John, Gorrespbl. p. 22. (2) Aper's
words ‘igitur . . . superiorem ' cannot be made-to imply the prediction of a
violent death any more than those immediately following, ‘si quando necesse
sit . . . potentiorum aures offendere) (3) Maternus had already disposed
of his opponent's warning in c. 12 ext„ rendering a renewed refutation
entirely useless (see John l. c.). —The other interpretation is open to equally
serious objections, for (1) quandoque—veniet is now closely connected
with the preceding clause, being thus deprived of any independent force,
as will be clear from a translation : ‘Let me not possess more wealth than
what Ι can dispose of according to my own wishes, at whatever time my
last hour may come.' (2) But supposing this to be satisfactory, we should
still have the correlation of ‘nec—que,' which ‘never occurs in Tacitus,
neque — que being also found but once, viZ. Ann. III 12 sed neque reum
prohibeo . . . vosque oro, where, however, it must be observed, there is an
interval of nearly two lines between the two conjunctions. There remains,
therefore, the interpretation offered above, which inVolves no violent
changes and brings out the full force of the passage. ⁶ Let me not possess
more wealth, etc„ and when my final summons too (et) shall come, then let
me stand upon my tomb,’ etc. It is curicus to notice that Wolff, though
he follows Ritter and John in his commentary (1890) adopts the very view
here advocated, in his German translation of the Dialogus (Frankfurt-a.-M.
1891). ‘und wann . . . soll man.’— ‘ Quandoque . . . veniet’ is not suffici-
ently characteristic either in thought or phraseology to be plausibly taken,
with Heller (Philol. LI 348), as a direct poetic quotation.

 

25 statuar tumulo: The local ablative of rest without the
preposition seems particularly characteristic of TacituS, although
not uncommon in other post-Augustan writers (cp. Dr. H. S. II
