Hor. Ep. II 2, 116 ff. Sen. Ep. 58, 5 quantum apud Ennium et
Accium verborum situs occupaverit 115, 7 and so πῖνος in Greek
e. g. περὶ ὔψ. 30. The sense of the passage is therefore clearly this z
Poetic ornament is no less essential to the modern orator than to
the poet, but it must not resemble the diction of old Pacuvius and
Accius,-incrusted as it is with an archaic mould which has tainted
whatever poetic embellis-hment it may have originally possessed.

20 ex Horatii et Vergilii et Lucani: The mention of Horace
seems somewhat out of place in this connection, and Ovid, some of
whose poems are little more than versified suasoriae (cf. Sen.
Contr. II 10), would perhaps have been a more suitable selection.
Virgil's great influence upon later rhetoricians is attested by what
Sen. Suas. ΠΙ 5 says of Arellius Fuscus: Vergilii versus voluit
imitari . . . , solebat . . . ex Vergilio multa trahere sqq.—Opinions
seem to have been very much divided as to Lucan's rank as a poet,
as appears from Mart. XIV 194 sunt quidam qui me dicant non
esse poetam, Ι sed qui me vendit bibliopola putat Serv. Aen. I 382
Lucanus ideo in numero poetarum esse *non meruit, quia videtur
historiam composuisse non poema, this identical objection being
made also by Petron. 118 and schol. to Luc. Phars. Ι 1. -Quint X
1, 90, though granting his poetic enthusiasm and sententious bril-
liancy, significantly adds ² magis oratoribus quam poetis imitandus.⁷
It was this very characteristic that caused his introduction into
the schools. Cp. Friedlander 111 378 ff. Heitland, in Haskins'
Lucan p. XV-XX. LXX Teuffel g 303, 5 Ribbeck Rem. Diem.
III p. 91 ff. The marked preference for these modern writers soon
caused a reaction in favor of the older poets which reached its
height in Fronto and his school. Cp. Friedl. 1. 0. p. 380-384 and
note c. 23 7.——-horum i. e. the class of hearers mentioned above
(1. 8).

21 auribus et iudiciis, is best not taken as a hendiadys, ‘auribus,⁷
referring more particularly to ‘sensus,' etc„ and ‘iudiciis' to
‘locus,' etc.

22 aetas pulchrior et ornatior extitit etc: Among the prose
writers of the first century, whose works have been preserved,
Aper's stylistic ideal may be found in Seneca, who, owing to the
unique contradiction between performance and precept which
distinguishes this literary genius, has himself severely condemned
the very style of which he was the foremost representative and
