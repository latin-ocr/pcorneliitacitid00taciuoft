otio 42 quietem et otium 40 tranquillitatem atque otium, but in
the later writings, ³ otium' or ‘ quies' is joined to ‘an,' e.*g. G. 14
H. II 67 V 10.-G. 40 IV 73 Ann. XI 7. Cf. also Cic. de leg. agr.
I 8, 21 summa tranquillitas pacis et otii and esp. Sen. N. Q. Ι 2, 8
significatur quies acris et otium et tranquillitas.

19 depacaverat=pacaverat. Of. note c. 7 17. The compound
is ἄπ. εῖρ.--ΟΙ1 ‘postquam' with the pluperfect indicative, see
note c. 22 8. —The thought here expressed seems to be peculiarly
Tacitean. Cf. H. Ι 1 dum res populi Romani memorabantur, pari
eloquentia ac libertate: postquam bellatum apud Actium atque
omnem potentiam ad unum conferri pacis interfuit, magna illa

ingenia cessere. Cp. Proleg. p. xxxix.

I read ‘maxime’ with Haase, against ‘maxima’ or ‘maximi' of the
MSS. The careful libration in the preceding members (adj.—genit.—
subst.) was abandoned, because ⁶ disciplina' introduces a new idea, ‘maxi-
me ⁹ emphasising its paramount importance among the causes that led to
the result here described. Hence also the sing. predicate, agreeing with
the last subJ'ect. Reading ‘maxima‚’ which> is, moreover, not a suitable
attribute of ‘disciplina,’ we should have three evenly balanced subJ'ects
J‘oined by et . . . et. . . et with the verb in the sing—an unparalleled
construction. ‘Maximi‚’ which is defended by Vahlen (Prooem. 1881) on
the basis of Sen. ad Polyb. 6, 5 principis maximi animo subici, is open to
the additional objection that it destroys the equilibrium of collocation with· ’
out separatim] the last member distinctly from those preceding.—‘alia‚'
found in some MSS„ is an interlinear gloss, as shown by the ‘ transposition

alia
variant,' omnia alia—CDV alia omnia—E (omnia). Cp. the numerous
illustrations of this kind of corruption given in Am. Jour. Phil. XII p.
444-452. That ‘alia’ is not necessary is clear from Petron. 4 primum
enim sicut omnia spes quoque suas ambitioni donant (cited by Vahlen

1. c. p. 9).

39. 1 ridiculum· · -videbitur quod dicturus sum, dicam tamen
vel ideo ut rideatur: Another instance of the figure ἀντιμεταβολή
on which see note c. 33 2Q.—It may be observed that the host l
Maternus would not likely apprehend that any utterance of his
would be turned into ridicule by his visitors. In the mouth of the
over-cautious Secundus, however, such an apologetic qualification
is very appropriate.

‘Videbitur' for ‘videtur’ is called for by its antithesis: dicam tamen.
If ‘ridear' were the correct reading, we should rather expect ‘vel ita
ut‚' for, as John ad loc. well remarks, ‘⁶ selbst ausgelacht zu werden, ko'nne
er hochstens sich gefallen lassen, nicht aber beabsichtigen.'' Andresen,

though he retains ‘ ridear ’ in his text, clearly translates ‘rideatur'z ‘⁴ wenn
Euch meine Bemerkuny ein Lacheln entlockt.'’
