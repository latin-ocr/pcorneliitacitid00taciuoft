11 voluptas spectare: Abstract substantives are often used as
the predicates of an infinitive. voluptas 0. 1111. is found, e. g. in

such distinctions were more than vaguely felt, 101· 13116 best and most
careful writers often use these words without any appreciable differ-

counterpart 01 ‘ homines novi' is unsupported by actual usage. He
leaves us the alternative of accepting this ἄπ. εῖρ. 01· 01 banishing
‘veteres' from the text, but its deletion necessarily draws that 01
