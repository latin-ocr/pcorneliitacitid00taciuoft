other wordS, is not, whether AB on the whole are more faithful
representatives of X, than ODAEV are of Y, which may be
admitted, but whether the readings of Χ, more frequently than
Y, furnish what Tacitus wrote. Now it is very remarkable to
observe in how few instances AB or AB(D) have alone pre-
served the genuine reading as against evident corruptions in
CDAEV, for even in those instances where the context alone
does not help us to decide confidently in favor of one or the other
variant, we discover, on closer examination, that the stylistic
usage of the author shows AB to be in the wrong. Many variants,
again, in which X is pitted against Y, owe their origin solely to
the false- solution of compendia, or to orthographical vagaries, the
scribes very naturally following the mode of spelling to which they
were accustomed or which they believed to be correct, without
regard to the MS. before them. Now all such divergences, be
they never so minute and apparently insignificant, are of no little
value, as will be seen from the above tables, in ascertaining the
interrelationship between the MSS. themselves, but as far as the
question of the respective authenticity of their archetypa is con·
cerned, they are quite worthless.ffi³ .

Ι first give the list of variants of AB (X) vs. CDAEV (Y), then
ABD vs. CAEV, to which are added the few variants in which the
genuine reading may be considered as doubtful :

2¹³⁸ This applies especially to such variants as: his, hiis, iis; ille, iste, ipse.
Thus AB show a decided preference for iste vs. ille in Y, and accordingly
Michaelis, true to his exalted opinion of X, has everywhere, except c. 30 22,
written ‘iste,’ even where this pronoun is utterly out of place. Binde devotes
an entire chapter (pp. 23-28) to the discussion of these variants, his aim being
to show that Y followed certain principles, whereas X simply reproduced the
reading of its copy. But as these pronouns were abbreviated (i cf. c. 19 4 33 23),
no inference as to the greater trustworthiness of the X class can be legitimately
drawn. Cp. Scheuer p. 33 f. note 1. In like manner, we must eliminate all
variants such as: non, nec, neque (fi), per, pro (pr.); que, quae, ᾷ; e, ae; artis,
artes3 diminuta, deminuta, etc. Others, however, like: constat, constaret,
videtur, videretur3 fatebatur, fateretur, etc, although oriqinally also due to
compendia, may nevertheless have been already written out in X and Y, and
they have, therefore, been included in the above table. Scheuer (pp. 34-37)
admitted all these variants on a footing of equality ! Many readings of X or Y,

moreover, regarded by him as yenuine are not so, while still others are unjustly
relegated to the doubtful column.
