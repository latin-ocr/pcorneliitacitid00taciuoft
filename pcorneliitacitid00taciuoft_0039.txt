η’ through the horrors of the despotic reign of Domitian, which
’ἵ threatened permanently to destroy what was still left of freedom

. in thought and action, and which could not but engender' that

longing regret for the better days of ante-imperial times which
vibrates with such pathetic intensity in Tacitus and Juvenal. The

J Dialogus antedates this epoch3 a more optimistic feeling permeates
the work3 the youthful author still dips his pen in sunlight. In
.> spite of this, occasional shadows flit across his page, harbingers, so

’λ to speak, of the storm clouds which were destined to darken the

’ narrative of Tacitus' later writingS.

‚ Of the three possible forms of government, Tacitus’ sympathies
’ -were undoubtedly on the side of the Republic,⁴¹4 but he clearly recog-
v nised that the times had changed, that amid the multifarious and
ever-widening interests of the Empire, peace and tranquillity could
Ῐ only be‘ secured by a monarchical regime.⁴⁵ We must resign our-

selves with philosophical composure to the inevitable‚ however much
3' we may deprecate the abuse of the one-man power and the demoral-
. ising effects produced by its*6 Tacitus is, nevertheless, convinced
’ that even under despotic rulers great and good men may live unmo-
3 lested, provided they do not call down upon themselves the wrath
, of the Emperor by injudicious opposition.4¹‘ Thrasea Paetus,

³ Helvidius Priscus and Cn. Piso ⁴8 demonstrated indeed the sincerity
of their convictions and the purity of their motives, and Tacitus
honors them for i't, but they utterly failed to bring about the
