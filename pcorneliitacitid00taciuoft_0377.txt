27 fecerunt enim et carmina: On Caesar's poetry, cf. Suet. Caes

‘Laudes Herculis,' tragoedia ² Oedipus⁷ quos omnes libellos
vetuit Augustus publicari . . . reliquit et . . . poema quod inscribi-
tur ‘ Iter.' Plin. Ep. V 3, 5 includes him, as well as Brutus, in
his long list of erotic poets. Only the six famous lines on Terence
have been preserved to us. Cf. Suet. Vita Terent. p. 34, 7 R.

28 in bibliothecas rettulerunt: This must refer to private
book-collections, for the first public library in Rome was founded
by Asinius Pollio in 39 B. o. (Suet. p. 130 R). Cp. also Mar-
quardt, Ram. Privatleb. Ι 113 f. Friedlander HI 418. -non melius
quam Cicero: Cicero was a prolific and versatile poet (Plut. Cic.
40) and many titles, together with very considerable fragments,
which, with the exception of the Aratea, are chiefly preserved in
his own works, have come down to us. (See Teuffel ξ 17 Ta 1. 189,
1-4). Plut. Cic. 2, on the authority of some post-Aug. writer, very
probably Suetonius (see Τναηεζ filmer. Philol. Ass, vol. XX p. 148-
150) SayS Προιὼν δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ καὶ ποικιλώτερον ἁπτόμενος τῆς περὶ

Ῥωμαίων. Ἡ μὲν οὖν ἐπὶ τῇ ῥητορικῇ δόξα μέχρι νῦν διαμένει καίπερ οὗ
μικρᾶς γεγενημένης περὶ τοὺς λόγους καινοτομίας, τὴν δὲ ποιητικὴν
αὐτοῦ, πολλῶν εὗφυῶν ἐπιγενομένων παντάπασιν ἀκλεῆ καὶ ἄτιμον ἔρρειν

disparaging criticisms principally found in writers of the 1. cent.
A. D. Cf. e. g. Schol. Bob. p. 306 Or. (probably taken from Asco-
