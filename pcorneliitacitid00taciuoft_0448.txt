272. 357 and see note c. 31 2. The impersonal use of ‘sufficere’
is confined to post-Aug. Latin—ad tempus ‘For the occasion.’ · So
also Cic. de orat. 1 16, 69 quid est cur non orator de rebus eis
eloquentissime dicat quas ad certam causam tempusque cognorit. The
meaning usually given to this phrase ‘for the time being, for the
moment' (See Seyff-Mull. Lael. p. 196, Το0. Α1111. Ι 1 IV 19)

2 uniforme: Apparently not met with elsewhere, except in late
Latin e. g. Macrob. VII 5 Apul. Met. 11 Aurel. Vict. Epit. 9
Arnob. Π 88 (uniformiter).—primum enim etc.: The thought was
perhaps suggested by Cic. de orat. 111 23, 86 omnes enim artes
aliter ab eis tractantur qui eas ad usum transferunt, aliter ab eis
qui ipsarum artium tractatu delectati, nihil in vita sunt aliud
acturi.

4 possideat · · · an mutuetur: An in indirect question with
‘utrum’ omitted, is more common in Tacitus than in other writers.
Cp. Lex. Tac. s. v. an (p. 77). ’ No similar instance occurs in Quin-
tilian. The same ellipsis 01101 ‘interesse' e. g. in Plaut. Most. II
1, 60 pluma haud interest, patronus an cluens probrior sit.—The
truth of 1110 statement is well illustrated by the Dialogus itself
which, in spite 01 palpable indebtedness to Cicero and others, has
yet preserved a high degree of originality. ᾖ

5 0110111 aliud agentes: Genuine culture will manifest 110011,
even in those parts of a speech in which the orator was not con-
sciously availing himself 01 1110 acquired knowledge. Most com-
mentators take the phrase ‘aliud agentes' 10 refer to the orator's
extra-forensic activity, his social intercourse and the like, but this
interpretation is quite excluded by the clause ‘idque . . . fateatur!
The phrase 110011 10 originally colloquial usage but of common
occurrence and opposed to ‘hoc agere,' ‘to do something inten-
tionally.' Cf. Ter. Eun. 348 Hec. 826 Publ. Syr. 115 R. Cic.
