154 NOTES.

gilii scripsit (among whom Bavius and Maevius are also mentioned,
cf. Serv. ad Ecl. III 90 VII 21), pauca admodum obiecta ei proponit ·
eaque circa historiam fere, et quod pleraque ab Homero sumpsisset,
sed hoc ipsum crimen sic defendere assuetum ait: ‘cur non illi
quoque eadem furta temptarent ἱ) verum intellecturOS, facilius esse
Herculi clavam quam Homero versum subripere! Cp. Ribbeck,
Proleg. ad Verg. Opera p. 96-113. ·

24 Asinii aut Messallae liber: Ο. Asinius Pollio (born 76 B. c.
cos. 40, triumphed over the Parthians 39, died c. 5 A. D.), M. Valerius
Messalla Corvinus (born c. 64 Β. c. cos. 31, triumphed over the Gauls
27 , died not later than 8 Α. 11.), both distinguished as statesmen,
generalS, poetS, historianS, and orators, and repeatedly grouped
together e. g. by Quint. X 1, 113 (where see Peterson’s notes), by
TacituS, c. 17. 21 Ann. IV 34 XI 6. 7. They are here introduced
only 'in their capacity as oratorS, their other literary achievements
being overlooked chiefly because they are contrasted with Lysias and
HyperideS‚ partly also because their fame as historians and poetS,
particularly in Messalla⁷s case, waS, in the judgment of later genera-
. tions, eclipsed by their oratorical reputation. Liber=oratio edita.
Frequent in Silver Latin, but not in Quintilian. See note c. 3 2.
