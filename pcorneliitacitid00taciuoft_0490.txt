Ant. I3 1017-1021.——dicendum habeas: Of. note c. 8 11-.-ᾱ6’

ambitu comitiorum: e. g. Cicero's speech pro Murena—On the
objective genitive, see note c. 34 275⁴ ⁵

18 expilatis sociis: e. g. the speeches against Verres. With the

phrase cf. Cic. pro Pomp. 19, 57 ad expilandos socios . . . legatos·

eduxerint. de off. II 21, 75 at vero postea tot leges . . . tot rei tanta

. . expilatio direptioque sociorum. ‘ expilare ³ does not occur else-
where in Tac. and is extremely rare in post-Aug. Latin, though
common in Cicero—civibus trucidatis 6. g. Cicero's speech pro
Milone, pro Rabirio.

The artistic libration of periods, perhaps the most characteristic stylistic
feature of the Dialogus, is rudely destroyed by the universally accepted
reading of the MSS. Apart from this, the use of ‘ et' after an asyndeton,
still extremely rare in the minor writings, in the present instance conflicts
with one of the four conditions, under which Tac. permits this departure
from earlier usage (in all about seventy times):

(1) If the asyndetic member-3 belong} closely toyether, another may be joined
to them by ‘et,’ provided it contains a new thouqht or more yeneral idea or
sums up. E. g. G. 30 6 (Halm) 44 5 H. I 36 12 II 95 9 IV 1 14 Ann. I 256
IV 32 10 38 10. ·

(2) If the last clause is composed of two parts, joined by ‘ac ' or ‘que’
E. g. H. Ι 50 12 V 12 4 Ann. XI 35 15.

(3) If the last clause is amplz'fied. E. g. H. I 51 28 Ann. I 32 13 II 568

XV 55 5.

(4) I f the last clause, whether amplffied or not, is not in what may be called
syntaetical symmetry with the preceding). E. g. Η. II 59 11 III 9 14 Ann..1
3 3 XIII 8 18.

Now ⁴ sociis' and ⁴ civibus ' belong as closely together as in Ann. IV 38
socios cives et deos ipsos precor or as ⁶ formula et interdictio.' We have,
therefore, a clear violation of Rule I. The equilibrium evidently intended
by the author (a : bb : ε a : bb) is at once restored and the stylistic objection
removed by the simple insertion of ‘aut' before ‘expilatis,' its omission
having been caused by the preceding ‘ aut.’ Cp. Am. Jour. Phil. XII
454-456.

19 sicut· · · ita, for the more usual ‘ut . . . ita! Cf. note c. 11 7.
With the thought, cf. 6. 41 6 atqui melius fuisset non queri quam
vindicari.

21 crescit enim etc.: For ³ crescere ' (in Tac. only here and H. I
33 IV 70. 76) or ³ crebresco' (H. Ι 39 Π 67 III 34 IV 12 Α1111. III
60), we find ‘gliscere’ used exclusively in the Annals (19 times),
in the Hist. only H 8. 83 IV 25. 43. See WVoelfflin, Philol. XXVII
144 and Lex, Tac. 8. vv.-—-On the thought, of. Tac. Anu. III 69
excitari quosdam ad meliora magnitudine rerum, hebescere alios.
