82 NOTES.

5. 1 vero occurs in constantly decreasing proportion in Tac„
‘verum' is first used in the Annals. Cp. Spitta p. 150 Dr. H. S. II
131. On the original distinction between ‘vero' as an asseverative
particle, and ‘verum' as an adversative conjunction, as we find it in
Plautus, cp. Langen, Beitr. zu Plaut. 113 ff. and in general Nagels-
bach Stil. ἓ 197, 2.—antequam: With the present subj. also H. I
4, 1. Draeger's rule (Stil p. 69) that quam, if preceded by a
negatived prius or ante, takes the indicative in Τ., except G. 13, is
misleading and not confirmed by the Lex. Tac. s. v. The indicative
occurs but twice in all.

Moderati is the reading of the X class, but this has justly been discarded
by several editors for modesti of the other MSS. Modestus is the vox
propria for a conscientious judge (cf. Tac. Ann. III 19 id solum Germanico
super leges praestiterimus quod . . . cetera pari modestia tractentur) and
hence modestia is repeatedly combined with probitas e. g. c. 29 7 40 9
G. 36, 4 modestia ac probitas, and also Ann. XIV 15 modestia aut quic-
quam probi moris.

2 solent sc. facere. Cf. Cic. Verr. IV 9, 21 fecisti ut praedones
solent pro Cael. 9, 21 faciunt quod viri fortissimi solent. Cp.

Anton, Stud. 100 ff.

The insertion of ‘se' before excusent is palaeographically soeasy that
there is no reason, in deference to MS. authority, to assume a ἅπ. etp. The
passage which Peter cites, in support of an absolute use of this verb, from
Ag. 42 audiit preces excusantis, is not analogous, for here excusare means
⁴ to decline,' sc. provinciam. If T. had omitted se, he would probably have
written cognitiones excusent. Wolff regards cognitionibus as a dative,
retains the preposition before iis, omits se and quotes Cic. Brut. 26, 101
oui tamen Laelius se excusans as a parallel construction Ξ

4 praevalere—-plus valere. Post-Aug. and most frequent in
Tacitus. E. g. Ann. XII 64 apud Neronem praevaleret H. ΙΙΙ 8
Ann. Ι 58 XI 28. 32. Suet. Nero 28 gratiae praevaleret.

5 usu amicitiae, etc.: On similar pleonastic collocations, especially
numerous in Aper’s speeches, see Proleg. p. cxvii.Cic. de nat. deor. ΙΙ
38, 96 says assiduitate cotidiana et consuetudine.—contubernium
originally designated, as its etymology (from taberna) implies, ‘tent
companionship of soldiers,’ and was then used of ‘ persons connected
by ties of intimate friendship and often living under the same
roos! In this sense, the word does not occur elsewhere in Tac.
For still another meaning, see c.13 1.--et-et after a negative,
which Spitta p. 142 (lenied to Tac. and to good Latinity generally,
again occurs 0. 34 11 Ag. 35.
