174 NOTES.

‘Non . . . contemnere’ is erroneously taken by Michaelis, Peter, and
earlier editors as a question implying surprise or indignation, the interrog&
tive particle being, as often in such caseS, omitted. This view is, however,
clearly refuted by the following ‘nam’ clause. Baehrens, followed by
John, reads ‘numquam,' but this emendation seems also superfluous, and
is, moreover, somewhat inconsistent with ‘saepe,' for which we should
rather expect ‘semper,' i. e. ‘You never cease, etc., for 1 continually hear
this kind of talk from you.' ⁷

4 fratris tui: i. e. M. Aquilius RequluS, one of the most notorious
informers and legacy hunters in the reign of Nero and of Domitian.
The occurrence alluded is known to us only from Tac. H. IV 42
magnam eo die pietatis eloquentiaeque famam Vipstanus Messalla
adeptus est, nondum senatoria aetate, ausus pro fratre Aquilio
Regulo deprecari. Regulum subversa Crassorum· et Orfiti domus
in summum odium extulerat. Sponte accusationem subisse iuvenis
admodum nec depellendi periculi sed. in spem potentiae videbatur.
Igitur Messalla non causam neque reum tueri sed periculis fratris
semet opponens flexerat quosdam. He was acquitted by Vespasian
and died in the reign of Trajan (Plin.VI 2). Pliny frequently speaks
of him, but always with supreme detestation and indignation, e. g.
'I 5, 14 Regulus, omnium bipedum nequissimus (quoted from a letter
of Modestus) Π 20 IV 2 VI 1, 4 ‘bene fecit R. quod est mortuus3
melius si ante.7 Martial, on the other hand, exhausts his copious

vocabulary to extol the virtues and oratorical accomplishments of
Domitian's powerful friend. Cf. Mart. Ι 111 IV 16 V 63 VI 38. 64.

‘ Antiquis' is unintelligible, and is very probably the gloss of some ancient
reader who, as John observes, took ‘ contendere ' in the sense of ‘comparare’
The attempts to retain the word by the insertion of ‘prae' or ‘parem'
ignore the pregnant use of ‘orator' (on which see c. 1 6). ‘Atque id eo’ is
palaeographically improbable. The missing conJ'unction is supplied by
reading eoque, ‘que ' being easily dropped, owing to the similarity in sound
of the letter immediately following. Cf. c. 41 12 obscurior gloria for
obscuriorque.

ζ 6 audacius: The comparative of ‘audacter' seems not to occur
elsewhere. —verebarisz The full form of the 2. pers. sing. pass. or
depon. usually occurs in general maxims in Tac.; in a direct address
here and c. 27 11 33 3 Η. II 77 experiris Ann. I 13 patieris IV 40
falleris. Cp. Sil-ker, Tae. Formenl. p. 49 and esp. R. V. II 354 note
2801). Quintilian never uses the shorter form, Cicero almost always.

7 ipse tibi: for the regular ‘tibi ipse,’ the antithesis being in-

tentionally emphasised by chiasmus, which in the Dialogus often
