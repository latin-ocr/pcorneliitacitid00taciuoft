22 anhelans libertus: “ Let no freedman in panting haste rouse
me from my sleep,' namely, in order to convey some message from
the Emperor, or to bring the information that his master has arisen
and is ready to receive the early morning visits of his ‘friends'
Cf. Epictet. Diss. IV 8, 41-50, quoted by Friedlander 1⁶ p. 143.
Schaubach p. 5 and Weinkauff p. cnvm erroneously take ‘anhelans '
to mean ‘maxime studiosus,' in which figurative sense the word
would be ἇπ. εῖρ. Cp. also Kleiber p. 7 5 note—incertus futuri:
Perhaps a reminiscence of Verg. Aen. VIII 580 spes incerta futuri
(cp. Schmaus p. 36). Incertus c. gen. is in prose first found in
Bell. Afr. 7 and then in Liv. I 7, 6. Frequently in the poets. In

to bequeath legacies to the Emperor in their wills in order to insui-e
the carrying out of the other bequests, for, where this caution was
omitted, emperors such as Caligula, Nero and Domitian (Suet.
Calig. 38 Ner. 32 Dom. 12) often annulled the testament, appro-
priating the entire estate to themselves. Nero, according to Sueto-
nius 1. 0., even went so far as to enact ‘ut ingratorum in prin—

, cipem testamenta ad fiscum pertinerent.7 Maternus, therefore,

sincerely hopes that, rather than submit to such compulsion, his
fortune, unlike the colossal wealth of Marcellus and Crispus of
which Aper had spoken so admiringly (c. 8), might remain within
moderate limits, so as not to excite the covetousness of the prin-
ceps. No other writer, it may be observed, refers to this practice
more frequently than Tacitus. Cf. Ag. 43 satis constabat lecto
testamento Agricolae quo coheredem optimae uxori et piissimae
filiae Domitianum scripsit, laetatum eum velut honore · iudicioque.
