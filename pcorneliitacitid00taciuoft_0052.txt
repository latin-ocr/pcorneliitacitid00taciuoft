indebtedness.1⁰⁰ This conscious imitation is of course primarily

responsible for the ubertas dicendi which pervades the entire-

treatise3 more concretely it is seen in the writer⁷s fondness for
collocations of a more or less synonymic and tautological character.¹⁰1
Of about 100 examples of this kind, fully one-half may be paralleled
from Cicero, our author often betraying his source by intentionally
inverting the order of the original collocation.¹⁰²

. But successful as the author of the Dialogus unquestionably was·

in reproducing the tone-color of Ciceronian diction, he was after all
but a child of his day and as such naturally as incapable as were
Quintilian and the younger Pliny, who imitated the same stylistic
model, of entirely effacing all traces of the idioms and the usage of
his time. Hence it is that we constantly meet with clear evidence
in the Dialogus of what is commonly, but very inappropriately,
designated as Silver Latin, so many threads, as it were, interwoven
into the Ciceronian texture.1⁰3

To these two strata we must finally add a third clement which
goes to make up the heterogeneous and composite character of the
style of this treatise, an element naturally less pronounced in

youthful authors of talent, but never wholly absent, namely, thev ,

individuality of the writer himself. It shows itself not so much
in the tendency to coin new expressions or to put old words to new
uses, a tendency very strong in the later writings of Tacitus, and
already noticeable in the Dialogus, as we have seen, but rather in

101 In Weinkauff's long list (pp. 39-47), the particular passages and even
the title of the Ciceronian works in which the parallel instances occur, are con-
sistently omitted! His collection (136 instances in all) contains,· moreover,
numerous repetitions and erroneous references, many collocatione cited by him
being more appropriately classed under the head of Hendz'adys, in the use of
which Tacitus cannot be said to transcend the limits observed by other good
prose writers. Cp. also Roth, De T. synonymis et per fiyuram ἓν διὰ δυοῖν
