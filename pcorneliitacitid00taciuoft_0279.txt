It, therefore, follows that neither ⁶ et ad causas et ad vera proelia' nor ‘ in
forum et ad vera proelia’ represent consistent Tacitean usage, but only
‘in forum et vera proelia’ which reading also alone establishes a perfect
rhetorical equilibrium between the contrasted clauses and preserves the
oratio bimembris so carefully observed throughout the entire sentence, cf.
also Knaut‚ p. 11. For ⁴ in proelia vocare ’ in place of the more usual ad
cf. Verg. Aen. VI 172 vocat in certamina divos. Cp. Am. Jour. Phil. XII
453 f. On the stylistic practice of other writers in regard to the variation
or repetition of the preposition‚ see R. V. III 729 ff. note 576.

27 plerisque patrocinatur: plerisque ‘many’ See note 6. 210.
‘patrocinari,' probably a legal term, is chiefly post-Aug. It is
never found in Cicero, and in Tacitus only here—obnoxium sit
offendere: For the infinitive after an adjective, see note c. 16 11
manifestus est accingi. There is a curious discussion on the mean-
ing and origin of the word ² obnoxius ' in Gell. VI (VII) 17.

28 effervescit: In its tropical sense, the word is a favorite one
with Cic. e. g. Cael. 31 extr. efferbuisse videtur huius vis.

29 aliquo, after a negative, as in 6. 6 init„ where 866 note. —
periculosius: Cf. 6. 3 8 11011 . . . securiorem.

30 necessitudo=necessitas. ἱ80 repeatedly in Cicero, 6. g. de
invent. II 20, 61. 57, 170. 171. Sall. Cat. 33, 5. Cf. especially
Gell. XIII 3 (An vocabula haec : necessitudo et necessitas differenti
significatione sint). John is, therefore, wrong in assuming ‘rela—
tionship' to be the only classical signification of necessitudo.
The same confusion occurs in the Ann. III 40. 64 IV 20 XII 30.

31 fortuitae et subitae: The classical equivalent for ‘extempo-
ralis' Cf. Cic. de orat. I 33, 150 subitam et fortuitam orationem.
The same collocation also G. 11 nisi quid fortuitum et subitum.
Ann. XV 58 fortuitus sermo et subiti occursus. See note 6. 6 ext.
and on the inverse order, note to 6. 4 3.

32 meditatus videris elegisse: Your offence, says Aper, has 110
extenuating reasons, for it was neither due to circumstances beyond
your control nor occasioned by a sudden impassioned outburst, but
with 6001 deliberation, as it seems, did you select for the hero of
your tragedy a man whose acknowledged prominence would lend
additional weight to his utterances. Meditatus is clearly the parti-
ciple and not the infinitive with ‘esse' understood, even though the
perf. pass. part. of meditor happens not to occur elsewhere in
Tacitus in an absolute and active sense. Cf. however, Sen. Ep. 20,
