6 111010103 tuos: Messalla was the only native Roman in the
company and hence ‘ maiores tu03,⁷ used as a synonym 01 ‘antiqui'
(01. 0. 25 5 sive illos antiquos sive maiores sive quo alio mavult
nomine appellet), is appropriately applied to the great orators 01
1110 Republic whom Aper had criticised so unsparingly. John and
many others understand the allusion to be to Messalla’s ancestral
relative, Messalla Corvinus, but this view is erroneous, 101· 11 13
(1) incompatible with the answer ³ 11011 311111 offensus Apri mei dis-
putatione,⁷ which includes Aper’s entire argument. (2) Aper had
expressly disclaimed any intention of attacking Corvinus (c. 21 ext.)
and while the reasons 101 11113 abstention are not particularly com-
plimentary to the ancient orator, it does not necessarily follow
that Messalla would have resented the criticism. (3) The plural
‘maiores' cannot refer to one distinct and definite individual,.tlie
parallel instances, cited by John from c. 34 3 and Cic. pro Mil. 7 ,17
in monumentis maiorum suorum being in no sense analogous.—

‘Apri mei ' seems 10 1110 0 111010 1110111οᾶ10οΙ correction 01 the MS. reading
‘ a prima' (aprilfi) than ‘Apri,’ which leaves the origin 01 1110 corruption,
unexplained. Cf. c. 5 ext. Maternum meum. ‘Nostri’ which is also an
easy emendation, seems less suitable to the context. — ⁶ nam nec ' or ⁴ nam
et ’ is quite unintelligible and probably due to the 10130 solution 01 a com-
pendium. Andresen writes Apri nostri disputatione nec mea vos, but this
is too violent a correction, the antithesis between 6 nostri ’ and ‘ mea ’ being
also uncalled 101. See Steuding, p. 10.

8 si quid forte· · · perstringat: ‘if ought perchance grate upon
your ears.' si forte with subj. also c. 33 32 31 10110 audierint H.

phrase itself, 01. 0. 9 5 licet haec ipsa . . . aures tuas respuant. and
Hor. C. H 1,18 perstringis aures. So similarly Ann. I 13 Q. Hate-
rius et Mam. Scaurus suspicacem animum (sc. Tiberii) perstrinxere.

9 110110 0330 01113 modi sermonum legem: In this phrase, Tacitus
again unintentionally reveals the fictitious character 01 1110 Dia-
logus. Cf. c. 14 20 28 5 32 32.—iudicium animi etc. ε ³ To give ex-
pression to one's convictions without the sear 01 injuring another’s
feelings.’ ‘ Adfectus⁷ occurs in the same general sense in 0. 23 25
310 exprimitis adfectus and H. Ι 15 Ann. XI 38 XIII 16. 21. Ι11
0. 6 17, in the more concrete· signification of ‘ emotions.' I can see
no reason 101 taking the word here as an epexegetic genitive.

10 citra=sine. Very frequent in post-Aug. authors, particularly
in Quintilian, but in Tacitus only in the minor writings. Cf. 0. 41
