INTRODUCTION (c. 1-0).—Taoitus having( been repeatedly requested
by α friend to enumerate tlie causes of the evident decline of eloquenee,
at Zenqth eomplies by furnishinq what purports to represent the faith-
ful reproduction from memory of a debate on this very question, which
he had heard on tlte oeeasion of a visit of liis teaeliers to the house of
tlze poet Maternus, ’

1. 1 Iuste Fabi: This Fabius Iustus is very probably identical
with the friend of the younger Pliny (Ep. I 5, 11 and VII 2) and
with the L. Fabius Iustus who was cons. suffectus in 102 (cp.
Mommsen, Hermes ΠΙ 137).--The transposition of the 'cog-
nomen' or ‘praenomen' is rare in Classical prose3 the seemingly
earliest instances are in Cicero (pro Mil. 3 Ahala Servilius, De ⁴
crat. ΙΙ 62, 253 Vespa Terentius, and some dozen examples in the
laxer and colloquial style of the Epistles). Schmalz (Ueber den
Spraekqebraueli des Asinius Pollio, p. 52) is, therefore, not alto-
gether accurate in attributing the introduction of this usage to
Varro (e. g. de R. R. praef. 6, 2 extr., de L. L. 5, 83), ” Sporadic
examples are met with in Caesar (e. g. Β. C. ΙΙΙ 83) and Nepos
(Att. 18) 3 in Livy instances multiply and in post-Augustan authors, ·
beginning with Velleius, this usage has become exceedingly common.
Cp. Mommsen, Ro'm. Forseli. I p. 41 ff. and especially Lahmeyer,
Philet. XXII 476 ff. For Tacitus: R. Macke‚ Die ro'm. Eiqen-
namen bei T„ who also notes the fact (Ι p. 12) that these trans-
positions occur in steadily decreasing ratio from the D. (25 70)
to the 2. part of the Annals (only about 6 70). Similar inversions
are found in Greek as early as Dionysius (e. g. Arch. Ι 6 Ἀγρίππας
Μενένιος 24 Βάρρων Τερέντιος), Which seems 130 indicate very clearly

'iat this usage must have been rather more common in his time
an the rarity of its occurrence in the extant literature of the

riod would lead us to suppose. —
