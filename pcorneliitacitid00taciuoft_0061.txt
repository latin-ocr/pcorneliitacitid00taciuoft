Finally, the style of the Dialogue exhibits most astonishing resem-
blances to the other writings of Pliny.

That these statements are partly open to the gravest objectionS,
partly of no argumentative validity whatever, can be easily shown.
In the first place, Pliny was only 13 years old in 75 A. D., the
dramatic date of the Dialogue, which fact renders his presence at
the discussion in the house of Maternus an impossibility, not to
mention the trifling circumstance that a boy, and be he never so
precocious, would not have been capable of following the conversa-
tion with intelligence. For, unhistorical as the reported dialogue
unquestionably is, the author, we must remember, represents it as
having actually taken place in his own presence. Again, Aper and
Secundus, the leading advocates of the period, are introduced to us
as the teachers of the writer, to whom he was devotedly attached;
Pliny, on the other hand, nowhere even alludes either to Aper or to
Secundus, but on the contrary expressly informs us that he was a
pupil of Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos 1¹¹4

Still another argument against the Plinian authorship of the
Dialogus must be found in the simple fact that Pliny himself
strangely fails to claim the beautiful⁸ treatise as his own, it being
not so much as even casually alluded to. The significance of this
argumentum ex silentio will be apparent, when it is remembered
that this vain author seizes every possible opportunity in his letters
to mention, for the benefit of an inquisitive posterity, all literary
productions115 that ever emanated from his busy and versatile pen,
even down to the most trivial doggerels.

Regarding Pliny's style, finally, for it is tiresome and needless

1¹4 I am sorry to observe that Hillscher, Fleck. Iahrb. Suppl. Vol. XVIII
(1891) p. 415, again assumes but one rhetorician of this name, identifying him
with the Nicetes mentioned by Seneca, Tacitus (c. 15 15 where see my note),
Pliny, Philostratus, one Automedon in an epigram (Anth. Pal. X 23) and
Hieronymus (to the year 32 Β. Ο. .· Nicetes et Hybreas et Theodorus et Plutio
nobilissimi artis rhetoricae artis Graeci praeceptores habentur). If so, he must
have been about 140 years old when Pliny came under his instruction! The'
elder Nicetes, mentioned by Tacitus, was probably born at the beginning of our
era, his ἀκμή falling at the close of the reign of Tiberius (see Seneca). In that
case, the above epigram refers to a youngyer namesake, Pliny's teacher‚ and the
poet Automedon will remain a contemporary of Nerva as heretosore, the reign
of Augustus, to which Hillscher assigns him, being out of the question.
