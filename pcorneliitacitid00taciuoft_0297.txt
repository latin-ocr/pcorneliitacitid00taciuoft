praeferenda. -According to L. Muller in Rev-l. Phil. Woch. No. 24
(1893) the opening lines have been preserved in Sen. Ep. 80, 7 En
impero Argis etc.-—Observe the artistic symmetry of this paragraph,
and the singularly appropriate grouping of authors. Homer and
DemostheneS, by common consent the greatest Greek poet and the
greatest Greek orator, are opposed to Cicero and Virgil, who occupy
the same rank in Latin literature. On the Greek side, Sophocles
with Euripides, and Lysias with Hyperides, who are regularly
associated by the ancients, are contrasted with the orators Asinius
and Messalla and the tragedians Ovid and VariuS, who are also
habitually grouped together. The Roman instances, moreover,
follow the Greek in chiastic order. Any other nameS, it will be
noticed, such as Aeschylus or Aeschines or Calvus, for instance,
would have totally destroyed the equilibrium of this finely elabor-
ated antithesis (a ιβ :aa : ββ :zb : a :bb ε αα).

13. 1 contubernium: ‘Association with the Muses) Aper (c.
9 ext.) had said that poets, in order to accomplish anything, must
abandon the intercourse with friends and seek the retirement of
the woods and groveS. Maternus does not deny this, but he rejoins
that such surroundings are particularly agreeable to him, while the
necessary separation from friends by no means results in solitude,
as alleged, inasmuch as it is the peculial· privilege of the poet to
enjoy the society of the Muses and it is their inspiring intercourse
that- he seeks. Contubernium in this less concrete meaning is
common in the Silver Age. Of. note 5 5 and Kleiber p. 39.-
timuerim=dubitaverin1 imparts a touch of politeness to a strong
assertion. Of. c. 26 33 11011 verebor nominare Plin. Paneg. 89, 1
Ep. IV 9, 7.

2 inquieta et anxia: Opp. to securum et quietum. The 861116
redundancy in Plin. Ep. ΙΙ 9, 1 anxium me et inquietum habet
petitio. With the statement itself, introduced to offset Aper’s
glowing description of the career of a successful orator, we may
compare Tac. H. IV 8 Ann. VI 48.

3 certamina et pericula: Pericula is added to ‘certamina’ as a
more specific term, according to the characteristic usage of Tacitus
pointed out c. 9 1. On the technical meaning of “ periculum,' cor-
responding to the now obsolete use of danger in English, see Peter-

son’s note to Quint. X 1, 36.—vel ad consulatus: Although the
consulship during the Empire retained but the semblance of its
