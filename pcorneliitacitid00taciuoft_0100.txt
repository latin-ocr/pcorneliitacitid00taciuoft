author for his information, the errors included. But since the
data under notice are of a nature extremely well suited to a work
such as we must conceive the ³ Acta⁷ of Mucianus to have been,
and as this collection is eaepressly cited in the Dialogue, it will be
more methodical to assume ,this same publication as the direct
source of Tacitus, while Fenestella or Varro may possibly have
been among the informants of Mucianus.

But not only were the Acta' probably laid under contribution m
the two additional instances just dealt with, but Tacitus' indebted-
ness to the Epistolae⁷ of Mucianus seems also not to have been

confined to the passage in which they are cited, for I feel convinced Α

11131 what we learn of the epistolary war waged between the ad-
herents of the Attio school and Cicero (c. 18 21 ff. 25 23 ff.) is
directly based upon this identical compilation, it being again
extremely unlikely that Tacitus had recourse to the not easily
accessible original letters of Brutus and Calvus,¹⁹⁵ when he might
have availed himself of Mucianus' laborS. The same convenient
edition of these collected letters was doubtless used by Quintilian

But the early date as well as the Tacitean authorship of the

Tacitus at the age of 27 would not likely have given expression to
