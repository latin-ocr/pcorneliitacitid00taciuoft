Ch. 24-32. After a few qeneral remarlcs on Aper's speech, Mater-
nus calls upon Messalla to make qoool his promise to discuss the causes
of the decline of eloquence (c. 24). Messalla beqins with a short
diqression, by first pointinq out that the ancient orators, thouqh unf-
questionably clifferinq in deqree, virtually represent tlte same type,
wlcicli, Aper's contention to the contrary, is far preferable to tlte
sensational style of modern oratory. About to prove this in detail
(c. 25—26), lie is aqain recalled to the main theme at issue (c. 27).
He thereupon proceeds to show that one of the chief causes of the
decline in question is due to tlte less thorouqh intellectuat and moral

. traininy of contemporary youth. (c. 28-33>.

4 quanto· · - incesseret: Aper not only displayed great talent
and enthusiasm, but also learning and rhetorical training, which he
affected to despise (see 6. 2 16), attacking the ancients with the
very weapons which he took out of their own oratorical armory, as
it were. Mutuatus is joined to ‘ingenio ac spiritu' by zeugma,
some general expression such as ‘usus est' having to be supplied
in thought. ‘ Locutus,' which Andresen following Doederlein prefers,
is not sufficiently akin in meaning to ‘mutuatUS,'—-a necessary

requirement in all zeugmatic constructions. As Maternus here Ἰ

praises Aper's speech for its erudition and skill, so Catulus in Cic.
