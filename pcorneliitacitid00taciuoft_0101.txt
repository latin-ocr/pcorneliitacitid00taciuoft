that Tacitus, here too, as elsewhere, may simply have followed in
the footsteps of one or more previous writers, and this seems in
fact to have been the case.

The education of children was frequently made the subject of Chrysippos.
monographic treatment by the ancients, more particularly by the
Greeks.¹⁹⁷ The originals have unfortunately been entirely lost, or
preserved only in meagre and insignificant fragments, but among
these Chrysippos' Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς seems to have been the most
ἔκ· extensively used. Its popularity was not so much due to any
originality of treatment, stylistic charm or profundity of observa-
tion, for the Stoic Chalcenteros was not distinguished for any of
these qualities, but rather to the accumulation of the opinions of
others,1‘'8 which could not but make his compilations a repository
of useful information, highly welcome to later writers. We are
accordingly not surprised to find that Quintilian, in discussing the
education of children, has recourse to this identical treatise of
Chrysippos, and, what has hitherto escaped notice, that the un-
known author of Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς, which has come down to us
under Plutarch's name, is also indebted for some of his material to
the same Stoic source. The indisputable proof of this is furnished
by the following passages : κ
