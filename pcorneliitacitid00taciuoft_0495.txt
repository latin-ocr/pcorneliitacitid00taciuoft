Ann. II 5 quanto acriora in eum studia militum et aversa patrum
voluntas III 43 quanto civitas opulentior et comprimendi procul
praesidium; in adversative clauseS, note c. 36 16. —in ore hominum
agit=‘in fama esse, versari.⁷ Cf. Cic. Tusc. Disp. I 49, 116 Harmo-
dius in ore est et Aristogiton Tac. H. II 73 erat in ore famaque

διὰ στόματος ἔχουσιν. The phrase is generally regarded as a remi-
niscence of Sallust who uses it, however, in the sense of ‘in
conspectu.' Cp. Schonfeld, De Tac. studiis Sallust. p. 30 Heraeus
H.·111 7 6. But this meaning is out of place here, partly, as John
‘well observes, because the phrase ‘in the light of publicity' does
not admit of a comparison (altior), partly because forensic oratory
naturally has its sphere ‘in conspectu hominum' or ‘in media
luce’ (cf. c. 34 10), as opposed to ‘declamatio' conducted within
the walls of the schoolroom.—aqit expresses the activity of elo-
quence, the personification being kept ,up throughout. On the
military metaphor, see Proleg. p. cxix (17); on the personification
of ‘eloquentia,' cf. c. 32 19 and note c. 12 7. ‘The more blows
eloquence deals out, the more she receives in return3 the worthier
her antagonists and the fiercer the battles she engages in, the more
will her prowess win universal admiration, the more glorious will
be her renown.⁷
There ought to be no doubt that the combined emendations of Latinius,
Lipsius, Boetticher and Orelli have succeeded in restoring the words of
Tacitus which have been variously corrupted in the MSS. ‘Nobilitatus
criminibus’ arose out of ‘nobilitadiscriminibus' (Vahlen, Prooem. Berl.
1881 p. 9). The same scholar (p. 10) is disposed to retain ‘ipsas’ on the

sole ground of an alleged analogous inconcinnity in c. 38 18 ab ipso tamen
Pollione, but see note ad loc.

38 secura velint, periculosa extollant: Men, says SecundUS,
naturally desire peace and safety (cf. Tac. H. IV 76 et neminem
adeo in arma pronum ut non idem pretium quietis quam periculi
malit Ann. Ι 2 cunctos otii pellexit. . . tuta et praesentia quam
vetera et periculosa mallent), but by a strange contradiction, they
nevertheless admire perilous achievements, although these are pos-
sible only under conditions, destructive of the very things they
fain would enjoy. Exactly the same observation and couched in
almost identical language is made by Ps. Plut. Περὶ παίδ. ἀγωγῆς
