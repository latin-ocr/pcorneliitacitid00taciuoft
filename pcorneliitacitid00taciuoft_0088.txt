lxxxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Quintilian, Pliny, Juvenal and Tacitus. Only a few selectione

from Brotier's restoration (?) can here be given, by way of illus-
tration. Thus the over-cautious Secundus is made to fulminato

‘ingentibus verbis' against the vices of his time 1? Seneca, who ἵ

13 dealt with at length, represents in his eyes the very incar· '
nation 01 everything that 13Ἷο3111301110 and corrupt in morals, ’

oratory and literature. Even Largus Licinius—save the mark!

—comes in 101 3 good deal of scathing (101111ηο1311011; an elab-

gratulated on his resolution to quit the 10111111 amid conditions

much abused rhetoricians (1), Quintilian being lauded to the skies, ἱ

human body, which passes from youth to maturity, and then to ‘j

and that every field 01 1111111311 activity has but one golden age, so to
speak. The language 01 111011 13 3 11111101 01 1110 1111103 111 which they ²

contradiction, be put down as having been dealt with in the

portions now lost. It is, as already intimated,¹⁷6 a more or less ἐ

circumstances, also retire.

uttered in 74 s75, is 01 0011130 311 amusing anachronism 2
