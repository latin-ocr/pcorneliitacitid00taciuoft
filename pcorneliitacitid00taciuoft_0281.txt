This consistent usage of ‘hinc’ disposes of most of the conjectures
enumerated p. 13. Still others, like those of Ritter, John, Heller have no
palaeographical probability. ‘ Ex his ' is simply an interlinear gloss to hinc.

35 ferri: ‘are soon in everybody's mouth! Cf. Mayor, Quint.
X 1, 23 (p. 79), and Pluil. Thes. c. 20 πάντες, ὥς ἔπος εἰπεῖν, διὰ στό-
ματος ἔχουσιν. - tolle igitur: That is very true, says Aper, but such
notoriety is incompatible with that love of quiet and freedom from
molestation which poets yearn for.

The missing thought is so easily supplied from the context, that it is
unnecessary to assume an actual lacuna in the text before ⁴ tolle‚' however
acceptable in themselves the conjectures of Vahlen (Prooem. 1881 p. 10 f.)

or of Andresen (Emend. p. 140 f.) may be. For an analogous ellipsis, see
Cic. pro Mil. 18, 48 quoted by John ad loc.

quietis et securitatis: The same collocation in Plin. Ep. VI 8, 2
cf. also c. 13 4 securum et quietum. ‘Securitas,' or ‘securus,' in
the sense of ‘safety, freedom from danger,’ which Heraeus, H. Ι 3
seems to' regard as the regular meaning of the word (‘eigentlich
Sicherheitsgefuhl'), is post-Augustan. In earlier writers, and here
as well as in H. I 3 IV 48, it denotes ‘freedom from care! Quietis
may have been added to prevent a possible ambiguity. Cp. c. 32 22.

36 adversarium superiorem, namely the Emperor.

The phrase ‘privatas controversias ‘ does not occur elsewhere. Moreover,
an adJ'ective (not pronominal) and a genitive J'oined by ‘et‚' as attributives
to the same substantive, is also an inconcinnity which is not yet found
in the minor writings and only a few times in the other works e. g. H. 111 49
quae (sc. violentia) seditiosa et corrumpendae disciplinae Ann. 1 35 saevum
id malique moris . . . visum. 11 43 Tiberius ut proprium et sui sanguinis
Drusum fovebat. These objections, taken in connection with the analogous
passage in Cic. de orat. I 37, 169 qui hanc> personam susceperit, ut amico-
rum controversias causasque tueatur leave little doubt, in my mind, that
‘causas' (edit. Bipont.) was accidentally omitted after ‘ privatas.' Knaut
p. 9 hit upon the same conjecture, but he advanced no valid arguments in
support of the emendation. —The codex Ottobonianus (E), which has pre-
served the genuine reading in nine instances as against the other MSS„
omits express-is, a word which defles explanation, for Peter's defence plainly
does not satisfy even himself, while John betrays by his unusually forced
and awkward version of the passage that the MS. reading cannot justly be
retained. See Proleg. p. cxxviii (5).
