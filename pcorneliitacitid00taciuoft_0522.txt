of Ceos or Bion. Cp. A. Gercke, Archiv f Ges-ck. der Philos. V p.
209. It is, therefore, not necessary to assume that the Dial. pas-
sage is a reminiscence from Horace. See below.

Ι cannot agree with Baehrens (Gomm.4Crz’t. p. 98) and John ad loc. that
the clauses ‘vos . . . essent' and ³deus . ζ . mutasset ’ express an alterna—
tive, for this would not only require ‘ et ’ for the second ³ aut‚’ and ³ aut ’ for
the first ³ ac‚' but also the deletion of ³ tempora.' John, momover, himself
admits that the first no less than the second miracle could only be realised
by divine intervention. The second clause is, in my judgment‚ simply a
varied reiteration of the preceding, as in c. 38 4 nemo intra paucissimas
perorare horas and. modum in dicendo sibi quisque sumebat. The deletion
of the entire clause ³ deus . . . mutasset' seems to me equally unjustifiable‚
for, though the Horatian parallel might have been recalled by some ancient
reader‚ it is not sufficiently similar to have suggested a marginal gloss or
interpolation in the form in which we find it in our passage. —vestra‚ as its
position shows, is quite out of place. It was originally written above the
line, being subsequently introduced into the text.

23 modus et temperamentum: Cf. Secundus’ words in c. 38 7
veluti frenos etc. c. 39 7 est aliquis oratorum campus etc. and
l. 23 frigidissimos quoque oratores ipsa certantis populi studia
‘exaitare et incendere potuerint.

25 bono saeculi sui quisque citra obtrectationem alterius utatur:
It is inconceivable that Tacitus put this advice into the mouth of
Maternus, if the same speaker had delivered the eulogy on the
superior character of the oratory of the Republic, contained in
c. 36 ff. With the thought, cf. Tac. H. Ι 3 non tamen adeo virtu—
tum sterile saeculum, ut non et bona exempla prodiderit, and Ann.
ΠΙ 55 (cited c. 15 2).—citra = sine, cf. c. 27 10.——quisque is the
antithesis of ‘nemo' preceding3 ‘utrique' would, therefore, have
been out of place, even if we take ‘alterius' in a strictly definite
sense; ‘saeculum' as in c. 1 1 is synonymous with ‘aetas' and
‘temperas

42. 1 cum Messalla: ‘inquit' is omitted as in c. 4 1 25 1 28 1.
—quibus contradicerem: Messalla the uncomproniising ‘laudator
temporis acti' was not likely to acquiesce in the opportunistic
doctrine advocated by Maternus in c. 41. It is to this chapter
that ² si qua obscura' alludes.

2 dies esset exactus: ‘exigere' in these and similar phrases for
,³conficere' is poetic and post-Aug. In Tae: H. I 78 exacto per
scelera die Ann. III 16 diem supremum noctemque exegisset Ag.
3 exactae aetatis terminos 38 exacta iam aestate H. IV 84 tri-
ennio exacto. With ³ consumere' H. IV 43 c. per discordiam dies.
