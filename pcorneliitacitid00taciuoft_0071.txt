PROLEGOMENA. lxix

justly abandoned. This identification is improbable on many
,· grounds. In the first place, it involves an impossible date for the
, composition of the Dialogue. Then again, the term σοφιστής 13 111
2 110 361136 applicable to Maternus, the poet and pleader, not to
,. mention that it is intrinsically improbable that a man of such
1 idealistic aspirations should sixteen years later have degenerated
1 into a mere school-rhetorician. Finally, the name itself is exceed-
ingly frequent. A Curiatius Maternus is met with twice in inscrip-
, tions,¹²³⁴⁵ while Maternus (or Materna), apart from the Spanish ι11111311
30 highly complimented by his fellow-townsman, Μ6113161,136 and the
two well-known Firmici Materni of the 4th century, occurs about
‘j 100 times.¹⁸⁷

J Maternus is undoubtedly the protagonist of the Dialogue, and
¹, may be considered, for the reasons given on p. xxxviii, as in a large
J· measure representing the author's personal convictionS. The scene
ἵ of the debate is laid in his house. He suggests the preliminary
s discussion3 directs the course of the conversation, answering for

himself and for Secundus (c. 16 8); 116 311111111611363 the arguments

. main theme at issue3 requests him to continue, at the same time
assigning the particular topic Which he desires him to treat. It is

As the great preponderance of the name in Vols. II and XII can hardly be

j the presumption being very strong in favor ot* Gaul, because both Aper and
j Secundus were natives of this province.
