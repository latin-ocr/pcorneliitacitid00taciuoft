of eloquence is not confined to the Romans alone, but applies with
equal truth to the GreekS, I am for this very reason the more
anxious to ascertain the causes that underlie so curious a phenom-
enon. The decadence of Greek oratory is generally dated from
the time of Demetrius of Phaleron (o.. 345—0. 283). Cf. Quint. X
1, 80 is primum inclinasse eloquentiam dicitur (viz. Cic. Brut. 9,
38) . . . ultimus est fere ex Atticis qui dici possit orator and J ebb,
Att. Orat. II 433 ff.

etiam Graecis · · -ut longius absit: The slight inaccuracy is occa-
sioned by the coalescence of two distinct ideas into one, namely (1)
Greek eloquence also declined3 (2) Its decline was more rapid than
that of Roman oratory. On similar incongruitieS, unquestionably

due to the author himself, and not to a corruption in our text, see
Vahlen, Prooem. 187 8-9 John ad loc. and note c. 3 17.

Graiis, which is preferred by some editors, is rare in prose and habitually
avoided by Tacitus.

15 Sacerdos iste Nicetes: There seem to have been two Greek
·rhetoricians of this name (Cf. Mommsen's Index to Keil's Pliny).
The elder and by far the more famous flourished in the reign of
Tiberius. Cf. Sen. Suas. III 7 Tiberius ipse Theodoreus offende-
batur Nicetis ingenio 6 memini una nos ab auditione Nicetis ad
Messallam venisse Contr. IX 2 nec Vibio nec alii contigisse scio
quam apud Graecos Niceti, apud Romanos Latroni, ut a discipulis
non audiri desiderarent sed contenti essent audire. The impetuous
delivery here ridiculed by Messalla, is confirmed by Sen. l. c.
Nicetes suo impetu valde Graecis placuerat and by Philostr. Βίοι

ἐκδίδωσιν. He must have been extremely advanced in age in 75
A. D„ the dramatic date of the DialoguS, and can, therefore, not be
identical with the teacher of the younger Pliny, who was at this
time only 13 years old. Cf. Ep. VI 6, 3 prope cotidie ad audiendos
quos tunc frequentabam, Quintilianum et Niceten Sacerdotem ven-
titabat. Reuter, De Quint. libro de cmm. corr. eloq. p. 68 identifies
this younger rhetorician with the one mentioned by Tacitus, but it
is intrinsically improbable that the younger namesake was distin-
guished by the same characteristic delivery predicated of the elder
Nicetes by Seneca and Philostratus The early date (32 uc.)
