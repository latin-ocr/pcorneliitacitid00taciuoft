 

C. 3. 75

15 inquit: Unusually far removed from the beginning of the
sentence, in which it generally occupies the second or third place.
We have a similar instance in c. 42 extr. ² at ego vos rhetoribus et
scholasticis' inquit, and in Cic. Acad. Post. I 4, 14. Iam vero . . .
adsidamus, inquam.——quominus:=quin, see note to c. 3 5. It is
here used as an epexegetic adversative conjunction. So c. 34 11
ubi nemo . . . contrarie dicit quominus iudex respuat (‘but that 1’>.
Ann. V 5 nec ultra deliberatum quominus . . . decernerent. Cp.
Dr. Stil ξ 187 and John’s note ad loc. who also adduces an ex-
ample from Cicero de Orat. I 16, 70 nullis ut terminis circum-
scribat aut definiat ius suum quominus ei liceat eadem illa facultate
et copia vagari qua velit.

16 modo-nunc for modo-modo is quite Tacitean. Cf. H. II 51,
III 85, but nunc—nunc (introduced into prose by Livy) occurs only
once, Ann. IV 51. In Cic. pro Mur. 40, 86 nunc is widely separated
from modo. On these collocations in general, see the exhaustive
discussion of Woelfflin, Archiv II, p. 233-254.

17 circa: ‘concerning, in regard to, in the case of.’ This use of
circa, which is chiefly post-Augustan, is first found in Hor. C. II 5,
5 circa virentes est animus. Cfnc. 22 12 28 12 G. 28 H. I 13 and in
the second part of the Annals, XI 15. 29 XVI 8. Especially fre-
quentin Quintilian (over 60 instances). For circa-circum (first in
Cic. Verr. Ι 126) cp. Woelfflin, Archiv V p. 294-296. — Medea: Omit-
ting the extant plays of Euripides and Seneca, the story of Medea
was dramatised by Neophron, and in Latin by Ennius (Medea exul
and Medea Atheniensis), by Ovid, and in the third century by one
Hosidius Geta, who, according to Tertullian, ‘Medeam tragoediam
ex Vergilio plenissime exsuxit.'—ecce: In Tac. only here. It
rarely emphasises a single word, as e. g. Plin. N. H. XXXVI 69,
203 Sen. Ep. 58, 7; 59, 7; 90, 2 Dial. XII 9, 8, nunc ecce. Ps.
Quint. Decl. 3, 4 Florus 4, 2, 10 Pervig. Ven. 81. See Kohler,
Archiv V 16-32 and Woelfflin, ibid. VI 2. On the etymology,
which is very controversial, cp. Kohler, Archiv VIII 221-234.-
Ecce shows that the announcement of still another tragedy from
the pen of Maternus is news to Aper.

18 coloniarum et municipiorum: The want of precision with
which these terms are used by Roman writers, makes it very diffi-
cult to arrive at a clear distinction between them. In the time of
Gellius (XVI 13) these designations are apparently regarded as
