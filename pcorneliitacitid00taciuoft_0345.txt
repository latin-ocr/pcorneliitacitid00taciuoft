mention of an individual‚ or to avoid confusion (see Macke Die Eiqennamen
bei Tac.) does not hold good for the Dial. Cf. c. 18 Graccho . . . Crasso
but c. 26 C. G. . . . L. C. c. 21 20 C. Caesari 23 8 f. Aufidii Bassi aut Ser-
vilii Noniani ex comparatione Sisennae aut Varronis. Neither S. nor V.
had been mentioned previously. 34 ext. where see note 40 3 P. . . Scipione
aut L. Sulla aut Cn. Pompeio. Here L.‚ omitted in the MSS„ has been
received into the text by all editors, for no other reason than for the sake
of symmetry. This design and no other is at the basis of all the collo-
cations of proper names⁴ in the Dialogus.

18 Appium Caecum: Appius Claudius Caecus, oens. 312-308
Β. c. cons. 307 and 296, statesman, poet and orator, the builder of
the earliest aqueduct and the Appian way. Roman literature,
jurisprudence and grammar (R litteram invenit ut pro Valesiis
Valerii essent,’ cp. Teuffel, ἓ 90, 2) may be said to begin with him.
His famous speech against Pyrrhus (B. c. 280) was long extant and
constituted the earliest specimen of literary Latin prose. The
present comparison with Cato was perhaps suggested by Cic. Brut.
16, 61 cited c. 18 8.

19 obtrectatores: On the defamers of Cicero, see note c. 12 23.—
inflatus etc: The very similar language of Quint. XII 10,12 ff. seems
to show that many of the oppnobrious epithets here accumulated
actually occurred in the very correspondence, expressly cited imme-
diately below, both Tacitus and Quintilian having probably taken
them at second hand from Mucianus' ‘Epistolae.' Cf. Proleg. xcvi ff.
‘Quem (sc. Ciceronem) tamen et suorum homines temporum inces-
sere audebant ut tumidiorem et Asianum (corresponding to ‘ parum
Atticum ²) et redundantem (= nec satis pressus) et in repetitionibus
nimium 'et in salibus aliquando frigidum (cf. c. 23 7) et in compo-
sitione fractum, exsulta-ntem ac paene, quod procul absit, viro mol-
liorem (= enervem) 14 praecipue vero presserunt eum qui videri
Atticorum imitatores concupierant 16 antiqua quidem illa divisio
inter Atticos atque Asianos fuit, oum hi pressi et integri, contra
inflati illi et inanes haberentur in his nihil superflueret. Cicero
'freely confessed to have been given to rhetorical exuberance of
diction, especially in his earlier days. Cf. Brut. 91, 316 Is (Molo)
dedit operam . . . ut nimis redundantes nos et superfluentes iuvenili
quadam dicendi impunitate et licentia reprimeret et quasi extra
ripas diffluentes coerceret Orat. 29, 104 (speaking of Dem.) sem-
per aliquid immensum infinitumque desiderant, where see Piderit.
——exsultansz Metaphor taken from a fiery horse. Cf. Cic. Acad.
