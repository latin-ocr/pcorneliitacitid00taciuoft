30 rursus: According to Woelfflin, Philol. XXV p. 102 rursus
is the only permissible form in the Dialogus. In the first part of
the Annals, ‘rursum' largely preponderates, while in the last six
books both forms are used in about equal proportion. It may be
doubted, however, whether this discrimination was consciously
made by the writer. For our MSS. are very untrustworthy guides
to follow in such matters, and the long list of examples cited by
Neue ΙΙ 748-50 seems rather to establish the presumption that ·
both ‘rursus' and ¹ rursum ' were used promiscuously and without
consistency, although euphonic reasons in prose (cp. E. Wolff, Die
Sprache des T. p. 10), or metrical exigency in poetry may some—
times have decided the choice of the particular form. The same
applies to the use of ‘ adversus, -um ² (cf. c. 4 5) and other similar
adverbs, on which 866 Neue Π Ρ. 743 ffi—-isque annus - - -
