years later, three years after AsiniuS, who according to our text is made to
survive him! Neither Clinton's suggestion to take ‘durare ’ in the sense of
‘ florere,’ a meaning not found elsewhere, nor Borghesi's transposition of the
proper names, removes the historical error involved in ‘in medium usque,’
etc.; and even granting that it did··, it would still remain highly doubtful
whether a difference of only three years‘between the deaths of Asinius and
Messalla could have been properly distinguished by ‘in medium’ and ‘ad
extremum.' Nipperdey proposed to read ‘extremum' for ‘medium,’ but
this is a most violent change, which, at the same time, leaves the origin of
the alleged corruption unexplained. (2) It is a suspicious circumstance to
find ‘ durare' construed with two different prepositions within the same
sentence, and to observe at the same time that ‘in . . . usque’ is
never used in Tacitus in a temporal sense and but rarely so elsewhere (cp.
Woelfflin, Philol. XXVI 139 Thielmann, Archiv VI 480-507 VII 105 ff.).
(3) The information, even granting it to be correct, is quite superfluous,
because the words ‘ ex . . . potuisse ’ possess all the requisite precision to
enable Aper's hearers to appreciate the point which he desires to establish.
The entire clause is due to a marginal gloss of some ancient reader,
perhaps suggested by the passage in c. 38 16. With this obJ‘ectionable
parenthesis out of the way, the ellipsis before ‘ne dividatis,' which has
been repeatedly misinterpreted, is now also more natural and easy. Cp.
Am. Jour. Phil. XII. p. 338 f.

The insertion of ‘itaque ⁹ or ‘igitur' rests upon the non-recognition of
this brachylogy.

28 antiquos ac veteres· · · potuerunt etc. : The entire statement
is somewhat strained in expression, but quite in conformity with
Aper's style. The speaker's main object was to show that Cicero
and his contemporaries were not entitled to the name ‘antiqui,’
because they are not removed from the orators of the present time
by more than an ordinary lifetime. In accordance with this view,
he regards the possibility that both Cicero and the modern orators
might have been heard by the same audienoes, as the chronological
connecting-lini< between them. This idea is slightly obscured by
