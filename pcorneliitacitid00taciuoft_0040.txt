realisation of the principles for which they suffered. Under these
circumstanceS, prudence and moderation must determine our mode
01 conduct, and danger must not be wantonly courted, so long as
honor and dignity are not jeopardised. Men like M. Lepidus,⁴⁹
therefore, L. Piso‚⁵⁰ Memmius->Regulus ⁵¹ and above all the historian's
own 18151181-111-18Νιν*52 receive his unstinted applause. The lives which
these men lived proveS, indeed, that there were not a few 01
Tacitus' contemporaries who shared his opportunistic views. But,
so far as these have found literary expression in extant utterances,
the Dialogus is the only work which can be said to breathe a
political atmosphere similar to that which pervades the historical
writings 01 Tacitus.⁵3

It is, 01 course, impossible to determine with absolute con-
fidence to what precise extent the sentiments expressed by the
interlocutors reflect the views of the author, 101· Aper, Secundus,
Messalla and Maternus are unquestionably drawn to the life, and
their individual characteristics stand out in bold relief 3 neverthe-
less, the prominent position assigned to Maternus, the very signifi-
cance 01 1118 own utterances, and the unqualified approval which he
is made to give to Messalla's explanation 01 the causes 01 the
decline of eloquence and to some 01 the salient features 01 Secundus'
argument prove conclusively that the poet-advocate must be re-
garded as the chief exponent of the writer⁷s personal convictions,
much inthe same way as the Crassus of the de oratore is the
mouthpiece of Cicero's own views But 11 this inference be correct,
and it has never been seriously denied, it is 01 the highest signifi-
cance to observe that the- coineidences between the historical works
of Tacitus and the Dialogus, so far as they pertain to political
opinions, are practically confined to the speeches 01 Maternus Ξ

Tacitus in the Annals dates the beginning 01 Augustus' reign from the year 43
