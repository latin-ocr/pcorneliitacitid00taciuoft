M. Aper.

lxx PROLEGOMENA.

MARCUS APER, known to us only from the Dialogus, is a man of

a quite different stamp. Born in some Gallie municipality,¹⁸⁹ not ζ

 

particularly favored‚¹4⁰ perhaps neglected by the central govern- Ξ
ment, he seems to have emigrated at an early age to the imperial ξ

city.¹‘²l Having acquired a ,thorough rhetorical training and an all-

round education, he soon succeeded, in spite of the obstacles thrown 3

in the way of a novus homo from a distant province, in reaching ’

the praetorship. But he too does not seem to have long survived
the debate in which he is given so conspicuous a part3 at all eventS,
he was dead when Tacitus composed the treatise, as is evident from

c. 2 5f.142 He is not mentioned either by Quintilian, who pays
so glowing a tribute to Secundus, or in Pliny⁷s correspondence, and

his name does not appear in our lists of the Roman consuls.

Aper exhibits all the sels-satisfied complacency and pride of the
successful sels-made man, and is naturally an enthusiastic advocate ᾗς
and staunch supporter of the existing political regime, under which ἓ
he was enabled to rise from obscurity to affluence, influence and ἶ
fame. His views are thoroughly utilitarian3 wealth and power ι
command his respect and admiration, regardless of the moral worth
of their possessor. ² Corriger la fortune ' is his motto. A man of -j

a combative and polemical nature, a shrewd lawyer, he does not

shrink from casuistry, exaggeration and even misrepresentation, if ”’

it suits his purpose.
His oratorical ideal is that of the modern school, as represented

Uebel aus dem unschatzbaren Gut eines festen inneren Friedens fliesse; in dem-
selben Sinne in welchem Tacitus selbst (see p. xli and note 67) . . . die Klage
iiber die Gegenwart zu massigen pflegt. 1 cannot afford to discuss the aberra-
tion of those critics who hold that the attitude of Maternus in the olosing part
of the Dialogue is irreconcilable with his views in the opening chapters‚ an
opinion which reached an absurd climax in the contentiori of Strodtbeck that
the closing utterances of the poet must be regarded as purely ironical 1

139 c. 10 6 ne quid de Gallis nostris loquar.

140 c. 7 3 in civitate (probably ‘city ’) minime favorabili natus.

141 He had also been in Britain, as we learn from c. 17 17, but whether this ³

visit antedates his departure for Rome or whether he went there in some official
capacity subsequently, cannot be ascertained. The latter seems to me on the
whole the more probable.

1⁴² See p. xxvi. The supposition that he possibly left Rome shortly after 75,
never to return, is in my judgment quite incompatible with the attitude of a
man whose very being was so intimately bound up in the city of his adoption,
and whose appreciation of the rewards of oratorical success, possible only in a
large city, was so keen as that of Aper. See c. 6 and 9 ext.
