Throughout this paragraph, Tacitus is intent on pointing out that an
orator, to be successful, must accommodate himself to the feelings and the
temper of his audience, an opinion also shared by Cic. and Quint. ll. cc.
but apparently contradicted by Aper (see c. 6 17). With ‘sunt apud quos
etc.’ the author proceeds to give some of the reasons for this requirement,
and enumerates some of the sources which may serve as models' to the
orator for the accomplishment of his purpose, in certain situations. The
particular character of the lawsuit itself is clearly of no importance what-
ever in determining this mode of procedure. Andresen's emendation
‘cuiusque causae’ (Emend. p. 159 f.) is, therefore, unnecessary. The pas·
sages, cited by him in support of this conjecture, from c. 23 23 Cic. de orat.
II 27, 115 Brut. 80, 279 Orat. 36, 125 Quint. IX 4, 139. 147 (to which 010.
311 Att. XI 6 ext. prout res postulat Quint. V 12, 14 prout ratio cuiusque
causae postulabit might have been added), are either quite irrelevant or
only prove that the phrase ⁴ prout res, (causa) postulat (poscit) is of com-
mon occurrence, but this fact does not justify a correction of the text,
which cannot be shown to be corrupt or objectionable on internal grounds.

21 instrumento sc. dicendi. The word frequently occurs in this
figurative sense. Cf. Cic. de orat. Ι 36, 165 Quint. XII 5, 1. 11,
24. In Tac. again H. I 88 instrumentum belli and of individuals
Ag. 14 instrumenta servitutis I 22 pessimum principalis matri-
monii instr. IV 7 boni imperii instr. Ann. XII 66 Locusta . . .
inter instr. regni. See also note to 0. 26 19.

22 sunt apud quos· · · meretur: The indicative after ‘sunt qui'
occurs in Tac. only here and Ag. 28 fuere quos . . . illustravit. In
the present passage, it may be accounted for on the ground that the
author had two distinct and definite classes of hearers in mind.
The construction is extremely rare in post—Aug. prose, though quite

common in poetry. Cp. Dr. H. S. II 531-534 Kiihner II 860 R.
