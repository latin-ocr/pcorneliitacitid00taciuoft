‘how little attention we pay' pro Sull. 11, 33 attende . . . quam
ego defugiam (where see Halm's note) Liv. XXVIII 42, 20 quam
compar consilium tuum . . . reputa. The meaning of the entire
passage is clearly this, The absence of stylistic brilliancy so
noticeable in the speeches of Corvinus is not so much due to igno-
rance of the requirements of a proper oratorical style but rather to
his mediocre abilities which prevented him from carrying out what-
ever οἱ good intentioris he may have had. But want of natural
talents is, in Aper's opinion, a less justifiable cause for censure
than mistakes of taste or judgment which imply a lack of proper
training. The truth of the criticism itself, is only partially con*
firmed by other passages. Quint. X 1, 113, does indeed deny vigor
to Corvinus (viribus minor) but the author of Ep. ad Brut. I 15,
1 has a high opinion of Messalla's genius and sound judgment.
ita gyravi iudicio multaque arte se exercuit in verissimo genere
dicendi. Tanta autem industria est tantumque evigilat in studi0‚
ut non maxima ingenio quod in eo summum est, gratia habenda
videatur Sen. Contr. II 12, 8 (cited 18, 1) praises the purity of his
ι style which Quint. l. 6. and I 7, 35 distinguishes by the epithet
‘nitidus,' a synonym of ‘ornatus' and finally Aper himself, in
apparent sels-contradiction, had characterised his diction (c. 18 11)
as being ‘ dulcior et magis elaboratus ⁷ than Cicero's. ——The entire
passage furnishes an example of the rhetorical figure commonly
known as παράλειψις or praeteritio. Cp. G. Gebauer‚ de praeterit.
formis apud oratt. Att. Zwickau 1874 Straub, l. c. p. 102-104 and
G. Gerber, Spr. als Kunst 112 p. 276 f.

The interpretation given above is based upon the easy and evident emen-
dation of John (Correspbl. p. 10-12) who clearly showed that the ⁶ videmus
clause' must be causal, furnishing the reason for the alleged oratorical
deficiency of Corvinus. Peter, followed by Andresen‚ assumed two coordi-
nate statements‚ (1) Corvinus was but a child of his day and as such under
the controlling influence of the prevailing taste and culture. (2) His natu-
ral endowments did not keep pace with his better judgment. John has
observed that the former of these assertions was equally applicable as an
apology for the shortcomings of all the orators whom Aper had no scruples
in condemning‚ and that there is no necessary logical connection between
the two remarks in any case. This is true, but it should also have been
added, that not even the idea itself‚ though the antithesis is common enough
(e. g. Sen. Fragm. 112 non fuit Ciceronis hoc vitium sed temporis Ep. 97, 1
hominum sunt ista non temporum), is in reality contained in the words of
the text; for they simply express a concrete statement of an alleged lack
of stylistic embellishment in the speeches of Corvinus,
