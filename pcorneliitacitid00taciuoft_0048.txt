xlvi PROLEGOMENA.

Relegating the reader for detailed comment to my Notes and to
the chapter on ‘ Style and Language,' Ι here content myself with
an enumeration of some of the more striking stylistic coincidences
between the Dialogus and the historical works of Tacitus.

a. The ‘ happy audacity' with which Tacitus enriched the vocab-
ulary of the language 9²³ is already noticeable in the Dialogus,⁹⁶ the
following expressions being also found in the later works, but not
elsewhere: histrionalis (c. 26 9 29 11 Ann. Ι 16), clientulus (c. 37 2
Ann. XII 36), educationibus in the plural (c. 28 23 Ann. III 25)
and perhaps et— et after a negative (c. 5 5 34 11 Ag. 35).

b. Expressions invested with a new meaning and apparently not
elsewhere in prose: cura = ² liber⁷ (c. 3 13 6 22 Ann. III 24 IV 11),
lenocinari (c. 6 24 G. 43), sacra = ‘ sacra loca' (c. 13 19 H. III 33
Ann. I 54. 79), inpexa in a figurative sense (c. 20 10 and perhaps
Ann. XVI 10), coqitatio = ‘ consilium ⁹ (c. 3 13 21 21 Ag. 39 H. I 27
II 74 Ann. XV 54), incitamentum, an extremely rare word, except
in Tacitus (14 times), and not elsewhere used of persons (c. 40 11
H. II 23 Ann. VI 29), obviam ire used in a non-hostile signification
(c. 41 19 Η. IV 46 Ann. IV 6 XIII 5), inauditus in a legal sense
first found in Tacitus and, with two exceptions, always joined with
‘indefensus' (c. 16 14 H. I 6 ΙΙ 10 Ann. II 7 7 ——Ann. IV 11
XII 22).

c. Expressions of very rare or not common occurrence in good.
Latin prose met with both in the Dial. and the historical writings
of Tacitus: quisque with plural predicate (c. 1 17), utricue=‘uter-
que' (c. 2 6), modo . . . nuno (c. 3 16), yloria ‘literary fame' (c. 5 10),
mediocritas (c. 74), inqero ‘din into the ears' (c. 7 14), notabilior,
honorificentius, audentius (c. 812 9 9 18 7), ἀπὸ κοινοῦ construction
of relative pronoun (c. 8 24), dare=‘dedere' (c. 8 30), concessive
ut (c.· 9 18), vanescere (c. 10 24), ullus as a noun (c. 12 14), adj. With
inf. (c. 16 11), sita for ¹ posita' (c. 18 2), use of quodsi (c. 19 15), etsi'
non . . . at certe (c. 19 21), adfluens (c. 20 8), nis-i quis—nisi qui
(c. 21 24), epexegetic que (c. 22 9), concessu Ξ* consensu’ (c. 25 12),
ante -post ‘superior—inferior to' (c. 26 31), numerare ‘esteem'
(c. 26 32), άείθ9ανί =³ committere ' (c. 29 1), habere =³ continere '‘

Differenzen auf Verschiedenheit des Verfassers schliessen, statt sich des Glfickes -
zu freuen, dass uns von einem denkwiirdigen‚ schriftstellerischen Entwicke·
lungsgange die beiden Endglieder wie die Mittelstufen erhalten sind.”
