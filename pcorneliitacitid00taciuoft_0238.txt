H. I 16, 50 II 38, 4 ΙΙΙ 49 totius orbis V 25 totius orbis. The
fuller and classic form also occurs 6. g. Ag. 31 G. 45 H. I 4, toto
orbe t. III 60 IV 3. 58 Ann. XV 13 toto t. orbe.

urbis, the emendation of Pithoeus, 'has nothing in its favor, for the exag-
geration implied. in orbis is especially appropriate to Aper's character, as
drawn by the author. Cf. 6. g. c. 5 18 totius imperi . . notitiam c. 8 4
non minores in extremis partibus terrarum. Totius, moreover, suits orbis

better than urbis. 866 the examples just given and H. I 73 totius civitatis
gratiam obtinuit.

12 gratia subnixos: Cf. Ann, XIII 6 g. subnixum. T. seems to
have been fond of this word. Cf. H. I 73 Ann. I 11. 47 IV 12. ΧΙ
1. XII 25. 54. It is not found in Quintilian. —in summa rerum

omnium abundantia: Aper again exaggerates in order to make his ,

point more effective. In Cicero, we find omnium rerum ab. (copia),
e. g. Brut. 93, 320 Lael. 23, 87 de leg. ag. II 97. Cf. also August.

13 togatorum comitatus et egressus: Toqati the better classes
as opposed to the ‘tiers etat' called tunicatus populus in c. 7 16.
John takes the word in the sense of clientes, quoting Ann. XVI
27, but this restricted meaning of the term is not in keeping with
the context—comitatus et egressus (repeated in Maternus' reply
c. 11 13) must not be taken as hendiadys. Andresen well observes
that egreSSUS, strictly speaking, refers to the orator himself and
only secondarily to the retinue of his admiring followers. Of.
Ann. XV 53 multo comitatu ventitare domum, egressibus adhaere-
scere, and Iuv. VII 141 With Mayor's notes.

15 consurgendizsurgendi. Cic. Rosc. Am. 1, 1 de orat. II 78,
316. The compound is used by Cic. only of a multitude de sen.
18, 63 de rep. I 2. Of one individual, as here, apparently first in
Livy: III 71 XLV 7 and not uncommon in Silver Latin e. g. Sen.
Suas, VI 27 Quint. XI 3, 156 Plin. Ep. IV 9, 18.—adsistendi is
perhaps best understood in the military sense, very frequent in
Tacitus, of taking one's position in the ranks ready for action3
