Orat. 1, 2. The rule 01 Seyffert, Lael. p. 104-106 that ‘est' takes

second place when it is the mere copula, but third place if it.

denotes existence, is justly called into question by 111111161- and is
very decidedly refuted by our passage. The position, 11 1101 wholly
arbitrary, seems to be determined by the degree 01 emphasis called
for by the context. ’

24 ex multa eruditione etc :⁸ On the climax, see note c. 33 19.

25 exundat et exuberat: Doubtless suggested by Cic. de orat. I
6, 20 ac mea quidem sententia nemo poterit esse omni laude cumu-
latus orator, nisi erit omnium rerum magnarum atque artium
scientiam consecutus. Etenim ex rerum cognitione efflorescat et
redundet oportet oratio. Tac. uses these words in a figurative
sense also in Ann. XIV 53 13111 1310 1611016 exuberat (sc. animus
meus) and III 7 2 exundantes opes. —admirabilisz Cicero repeatedly
contends that it must be the ultimate aim of the orator to render
his speech worthy of admiration. Cf. de opt. gen. 4, 12 quid?
dubium est, utrum orationem nostram tolerabilem tantum an etiam
admirabilem esse cupiamus ‘? Quint. VIII 3, 6 recteque Cicero his
“ ipsis ad Brutum verbis quadam in epistula (not extant) scribit:
‘nam eloquentiam, quae admirationem non habet, nullam iudico.
See also Sandys’ note to Orat. 28, 97. In selecting this particular*
epithet, therefore, Tacitus not only endorses Cicero's own view, but
at the same time also pays a very high compliment to his oratorical
excellence.

26 orationis vis et facultas: Vis and facultas are frequently⁴
combined. Cf. 6. g. Cic. de orat. I 31, 142 Quint. XII 1, 33.

Andresen (Emend. p. 157 1.) objects to the reading ‘ceterae artes' as an.
illogical correlative to oratoris, ⁴ rerum ' 111 1116 861186 01 ‘ artium ’ being in
his opinion also inadmissible. The latter objection is abundantly refuted by'
Cic. de orat: I 5, 19. 6, 20 (cited in previous note as the model 01 Τ36.) 28,
128 111 22, 84 (quoted c. 32 11). The inconcinnity pointed out may be ad-
mitted3 it is, however, paralleled by similar incongruities in the use 01,
‘ceteri' and ‘ alius.' Cf. Tac. H. IV 56 leqatis tantum legionum interfectis,
ceterum vulgus Ann. I 31 III 42 (where see Nipp.) XV 37 Cic. Verr. I 1,
16, 47 Nep. Eum. 7, 1. The traditional reading might, therefore, be
plausibly defended. All difficulties, however, vanish 31 01166, 11 we write-
orationis (an emendation curtly dismissed by Andresen) for ‘ oratoris.' The·
two nouns are often confused in 1116 MSS. e. g. in Quint. Ι 10, 27 VI 2, 19
Χ 2, 12 XII 1, 11. —The passages cited by Kleiber p. 30 and John ad loc.
in support 01 1116 601106311οη 01 ‘ oratoris ' with ⁶ vis' or ‘ facultas' seem to
me quite irrelevant, as no antithesis with ‘artes' or ‘res' is either ex*
pressed or implied in any 01 1116111.
