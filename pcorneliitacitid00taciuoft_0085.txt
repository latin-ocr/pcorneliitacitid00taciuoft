entire extant treatise. Now if we assume him to have continued
down to c. 40 8, including the certainly not inconsiderable portions
lost in the lacuna, he would have given all the causes of the decline
of eloquence, thus practically monopolising the entire conversation
after the close of Aper's speech, ——a preposterous supposition, un-
worthy of the literary artist who penned the Dialogue, and flatly
contradicted, not only by c. 16 5 ff„ but also by the fact that
Messalla had ceased speaking at c. 32 ext„ being prevailed upon
only at the urgent request of the host to bring his discussion to
its proper close. But what follows from c. 36 on deals with an

3 entirely different subject. If, therefore, for the reasons given,

neither Maternus nor Messalla can be the speakers of the part
between the two lacunae, there remains only Secundum, the histo-
rian. How perfectly in keeping with his attainments and convic-
tions the passages thus assigned to him are, must be clear from
the foregoing remarks. We have also seen that there are other
strong grounds for believing that Secundus was not relegated to
the background, and that the very phrase in c. 39 9 ipsam quin
immo curam et diligentis stili anxietatem contrariam experimur
is preeminently appropriate to the individual whom Quintilian
had characterised as being ‘infinitae tamen curae.'

There is still one objection to the view here advocated which
calls for a brief consideration, as it has often been advanced to
show that an important role cannot well have been assigned to
Secundus in this debate, ——namely, the omission of his name at the
close of the treatise [‘Ego' inquit (sc. Maternus) ‘te poetis, Messalla
antiquariis criminabimur⁷ ‘At ego (sc. Aper) vos rhetoribus et
scholasticis' inquit] A little reflection, however, will, Ι am con-
fident, be sufficient to dispose of this objection also, as it proceeds
from a strange misconception of the attitude of the respective
speakers. For Secundus, alone of the interlocutors‚ though an
admirer of the ancients, nowhere exhibits the uncompromising
antagonism toward contemporary oratory so marked in Messalla's
answer to Aper, nor again does he extol poetry at the expense of
eloquence, as does Maternus in opposition to 'the same Aper.
Furthermore, both Aper and Messalla attack or eulogise certain
oratorical manifestations in the persons of their chief representa-
tives; Secundus, on the other hand, simply analyses conditione from
an objective, historical point of view. His strong partiality for the
