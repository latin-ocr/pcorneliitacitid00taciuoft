Spoletinus in 65 Β. 6. (Cic. Brut. 78, 271) for proposing laws, when
trib. pleb. (67 B.c.), distasteful to the senatorial party, he was
successfully defended by Cicero in two speeches, of which con-
siderable fragments together with ‘the argument of Asconius have
come down to us. Cf. Ascon. Ped. p. 50-7 2 K.-S. and Orelli, Cic. IV
932-939. -M. Scaurum: M. Aemilius Scaurus aedile 58 B. o. praetor
of Sardinia 56, accused ‘ rerum repetundarum' in 54. He was de-

fended by six ‘ patroni,' viz. P. Clodius, M. Marcellus, M. Calidius, .

Μ. Messalla Niger, Q. Hortensius and Cicero, Cato being the judge.
The sensational trial ended in an acquittal. Cicero⁷s speech is only
preserved in fragments Cf. Cic. Fragm. IV 954-965 Ascon. p. 18 ff.

Bestia, trib. pleb. 62 Rc. one of the Catilinian conspirators (Sall.
Cat. 17), was accused ‘de ambitu⁷ in 56 and unsuccessfully defended
by Cicero. Cf. Ep. ad Quint. frat. Π 3, 6 a. d. ΙΙΙ. Id. Feb. dixi
pro Bestia de ambitu apud praetorem Cn. Domitium . . . maximo
conventu. No fragments of this speech have come down to us. --
