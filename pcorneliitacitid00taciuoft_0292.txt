1. c. regards the above passage as an echo of the Stoicism of the
author's day, rather than a litei-ary reminiscence. This may be
true, but the parallel utterances in the Dialogus do not appear to
have been taken from this source directly, but were more probably
due to Cicero’s Hortensius, a work to which Tacitus is more largely
indebted than has been hitherto supposed. See note c. 16 24 and
Proc. Amer. Philol. Assoc. vol. XXII p. 46 ff. Proleg. p. xciii f.

14 ullis: Ulli takes the place of the plural of ‘quisquam‚' which
does not occur 111 Latin, as Charisius 2, 7 expressly informs us:
unum autem adest (sc. pronomen) quam semper singulare. Non
enim ut quisquam quemquam sic utique quiquam quosquam dici-
mus. As a substantive ‘ulli’ is, however, very rare in prose. A few
times in Cicero e. g. Tusc. Disp. I 1, 2 111 ullis 6, 11 ne sunt quidem
apud inferos ulli pro Sull. 5, 16 (10 orat. II 37, 154 and in Tac. only
here and in Ann. XI 27 ullis mortalium. Cp. R. V. III p. 69 ff.

The reading gloriamor in all our MSS. was due to metathesis, an exceed-
ingly frequent source of error. To the instances cited by Vahlen, Prooem.
1881 which might be greatly emended, a few examples from so carefully
written a MS. as the Mediceus of Tacitus may be added: Ann. III 18
aspernas = Asprenas 76 ipso = Piso IV 45 examinaretur = exanimaretur
VI 15 clavisio = Calvisio. This unmistakable origin of the corruption
disposes of Michaelis’ conjecture ‘gloria mortalibus maion' The lacuna.
indicated in our MSS. makes it highly probable that a word like ‘erat'
dropped out, owing to the similarity of the following word.

15 proferre responsa: i. e. as ὑποφῆται τῶν θεῶν. Cf. Plato,
Phaedr. 262 Ε Μουσῶν προφῆται Theocr. 16, 29 Μουσάων . . . τίειν
ἱεροὺς ὖποφήτας 17, 115 Μουσάων ὑποφῆται 22, 116 Hor. A. P. 391
sacer interpresque deorum . . . Orpheus. — interesse epulis: It was
a common belief among the ancients that this honor was accorded
to illustrious men of the heroic age, e. g. to Hercules (Hor. C. IV
8, 27> Tantalus (Eur. Orest. 9 Hor. O. I 28, 7 conviva deorum).
Nestor says Of Athene (γ 420) Ἠ μοι ἐναργὴς ἦλθε θεοῦ ἐς δαῖτα θάλειαν,
and so the gods, according to Alcinous (η 201 ff.), were wont to
feast with the PhaeacianS. In the Golden Age, in fact, the gods
were thought to associate with mortals on terms of equality. See
Hes. fr. 218 Mk. Ξυναὶ ’γὰρ τότε δαῖτες ἔσαν, ξυνοὶ δὲ θόωκοι Ι ἀθανά-
τοισι θεοῖσι καταθνητοῖς τ’ ἀνθρώποις Paus. VIII 2, 2 οἱ γὰρ δὴ τότε
ἄνθρωποι ξένοι καὶ ὁμοτράπεζοι θεοῖς ἦσαν. Cat. LXIV 384 ff. praesentes
