 

C. 21. 229

With the present passage, cf. Quint. Prooem. 24 omnem sucum
ingenii bibunt et ossa dotequnt II 4, 9 macies illis pro sanitate et
iudicii loco infirmitas est V 12, 6 si non nudos et velut carne
spoliatos artus ostenderint Cic. Brut. 17, 68 utinam imitarentur nec
ossa solum sed etiam sanguinem (on the Atticists).

This hopelessly corrupt passage has exercised the ingenuity of critics from
the time of Lipsius, but none of the emendations hitherto offered, not
excluding the one adopted in the text, are entirely convincing or free from

obJ'ections. For the older attempts at restoration, see Schulze's edition,
Exc. III p. 171-174, and Walther (Eckstein) ad loc.

- 5 ipse: On the ellipsis of sed, cp. note c. 6 19.

6 libros=orationeS, cp. note c. 3 2. —vix in una aut altera ora-
tiuncula i. e. in one or the other speech, picked out at random. On

¹ the necessity of aut for et, cf. note c. 9 20. So always when ³ vix'

is added e. g. Plin. Ep. V 20, 5 vix uni aut alteri . . . contigit Tac.
Gr. 9, 6 vix uni alterive. —The diminutive is here used by way of
disparagement.

7 nec dissentire ceteros etc: This statement cannot well. have
been put into the mouth of Aper, if it were true, as Reuter, Dc
Quint. libro qui fuit dc causis corr. εἷος. p. 71 contends, that the
Dialogus was written shortly before t'he death of Domitian, i. e.
after the publication of the Institutio, for we there read X 1, 115
inveni qui Calvum praeferrent omnibus etc. (cited in full c. 18 6) a
preference certainly not based on the Vatiniana alone. I, there-
fore, suspect that this reaction in favor of Calvus and the Atti-
cists had not yet taken place at the time when Aper's words are
supposed to have been uttered. And as Tacitus has not been guilty
of any anachronisms in the Dialogus, there will have been an
interval of nearly twenty years between it and Quintilian's remark,
a period sufficiently long to allow of the variations in oratorical
criticism here implied. On hoo memes. c. 4 1.—-qu0tus quisque
‘how few,' cf. note c. 10 6.

8 Calvi sc. libros or orationes. This ellipsis is rare, except after
numerals. Of. Cic. ad Att. XII 23, 2 ex Apollodori XIII 32, 3
eum video in Libonis praetorem Orat. 70, 233 sume de Gracchi
apud censoreS, a passage which unfortunately escaped Reid, for it
would have prevented him, on his own admission, from inserting
‘ea' in Acad. Post. 4, 13 quae contra Philonis, Antiochus scri-
pserit. Occasional instances are also found in very late Latin e. g.
