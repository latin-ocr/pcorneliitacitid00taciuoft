XXX PROLEGOMENA.

admitted to a conversation which took place in the house of a
friend of his teachers, yet remained so studiously in the back-
ground as not even to represent himself as joining in the general
laughter at the close.3⁷ We, therefore, conclude that no argument
against the date of composition under Titus, the only date compat-
ible with Tacitean authorship, can be legitimately drawn from the
phrase ‘iuvenis admodum!

We proceed to the discussion of the second objection, that the
Dialogus cannot have been published while Crispus was still living
and in power. It requires but little penetration to see that this
argument, so far from invalidating the early date here advocated,
rather confirms it in a remarkable manner. Vibius Crispus, no less
feared as an informer than Eprius Marcellus, who had to commit
suicide after being detected in a conspiracy against Vespasian in
79, repeatedly got into trouble under this same emperor (cf. Tac.
H. IV 41. 43). During the reign of Domitian, as we have seen, he
was again in high favor, but under Titus we hear nothing of him.
See also note c. 8 21. Now what, I ask, can be more probable than
the supposition that Crispus was at that time in disgrace, for Titus,
as Suet. Tit. 8 expressly informs us, hated this whole class of
‘delatores,' even going to the extent of prosecuting them with vigor
throughout his short reign. But instead of adopting this common-
sense and intrinsically plausible explanation, which is in perfect
keeping with the necessary presumption that the Dialogus is a
genuine work of Tacitus, we are called upon to assume a date
toward the close of Domitian's reign, apparently for no other
reason than that such a supposition would compel us to attribute
our treatise to some unknown cultured contemporary 1³8 But the
refutation of the objections of Andresen and his allies after all only
justifies the inference that the Dialogus may have been written in

8⁷ See note to adrisissent, discessimus (c. 42 ext).

38 This pernicious mode of argumentation, which meets us at every turn in
discussions on the authenticity of the Dialogus, has been so well characterised -
by Ritschl, Opusc. I 43, that I cannot refrain from reproducing his protest
here: ‘⁶ Man wetteifert den Bericht des Alterthums zu verdachtigen, als wenn
von vornherein die Aufgabe galte sich eines widerstrebenden Zeugnisses um
jeden Preis zu entledigen, wahrend doch alle Grundsatze historischer Kritik die
Sache gerade umzukehren und eine vielverbfirgerte Ueberlieferung festzuhalten
gebieten‚ sobald sie erstens in sich selbst vernfinftig zusammenhangt und
zweitens durch anderweitige Bedenken und Gegengrunde nicht, erschiittert

wird. ' '
