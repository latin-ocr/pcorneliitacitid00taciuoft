xviii PRoLEGoMENA.

supposed to attach to the troublesome and apparently irrefutable
objections derived from the style of the treatise, they now happily
all paled into utter insignificance by the side of the unimpeachable
testimony of a contemporary of Tacitus! Quod volunt, credunt.
Among the many scholars who confidently and often in very strong
terms⁹ expressed themselves 'in favor of the genuineness of the
treatise, may be mentioned Boeckh, Niebuhr, Hofman-Peerlkamp,
Dronke, Seebode, Ruperti, Bach, Ritter, Orelli, Doederlein, Schopen,
Nipperdey, Massmann, Walch, Teuffel.

The consternation in the ranks of the opposition, caused by so
unexpected an assault upon what appeared to be a fairly impreg-
nable position, is well reflected in the absurd attempts made two
years later by Gutmann (1830) and subsequently by Fr. Hess, who,
though guided by different motives, both endeavored to neutralise
Lange's argument by contending that the letter in question was
not by Pliny, but by Tacitus, it having by some strange accident
found its way into Pliny's correspondence 1 It might seem incred-
ible, were it not for the reasons given above, that Lange’s inference
should have blinded the eyes of scholars to its utterly fallacious
character for a quarter of. a century, for it was not till 1855 that
Haase disposed of it by convincing arguments.1⁰ Two years after·

9 Teuffel, Introd. to his transl. p. 20 ᾗ, well voices the sentiment of contem--
porary scholars : Die Zweifel an dem Taciteischen Ursprung unserer Schrift . . .
sind vollends zu nahezu mutwillissen geworden, seitdem A. G. Lange darauf
hingewiesen hat, dass wir fiir die Urheberschaft des Tacitus ein Zeugniss haben,
wie fiir wenig andere aus dem Alterthum etc.

10 The grounds upon which Pliny's alleged testimony must be peremptorily
reJ'ected may be briefly summarised : (1) The context of the letter can leave no
doubt that ‘quae 'ru inter nemora et lucos commodissime perfici PUTAs' and
the words immediately preceding ‘quas TU A1s pariter colendas etc.’ refer to·
one and the same source, but the latter statement has nothing whatever toa
correspond to it in the Dialogus. (2) The parallelism in question is a literary
commonplace as old as Hesiod's Theogony‚ and the identical collocation
‘nemora et lucos' is found not only in other Tacitean passages but also else-
where. See my note to c. 931. (3) Tu putas cannot possibly contain a refer- ⁴
ence to the Dialogus, unless we absurdly suppose that Pliny totally overlooked
the fact that Tacitus expressly disclaims the thought in question as his own, it.
being introduced as an opinion common to poets (ut ipsi dicunt). (4) It is-
incredible in any case that Pliny would have quoted a sentiment from a treatise
of Tacitus written fifteen years or more previous, for the adherents of Lange,
with the exception of Nipperdey, all agree in assigning an early date to our
treatise. (5) The very *vagueness of the reference in a correspondence intended
for publication and by a writer so habitually πολύλογος as Pliny were also very'
