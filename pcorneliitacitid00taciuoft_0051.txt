while the writer of the Dialogus is ‘dulcis et candidus et 1118118; 1116

:¹ vi [melior], hic voluptate.' And such, it is true, must be the super-
ficial impression which every reader will carry away from a perusal

ζ’ 01 1116 historical works and the rhetorical treatise, but it 18, never-

1 11161688, 6 0116-81666 0116, because superficial. A closer examination‚
Ξ 68 1116 above coincidences, intentionally selected almost exclusively
from the Histories and Annals, must have made tolerably clear, on
the one hand utterly invalidam-s the assertion 01 Lipsius and his
followers that the Annals and our treatise, published more than
thirty years previouS, have absolutely no stylistic features in com-
‡ mon, while on 13116 011161, 11 68 fully conflrms Lipsius⁷ dictum ‘mutari

.- But 11 we must needs admit that remarkable stylistic coincidences
exist side by side with equally remarkable stylistic divergencies,

all objections urged against Tacitean authorship, quite independent
of the weighty internal evidence already adduced, will be disposed
ἧς 01, 11 we finally succeed in giving some plausible answer to the
following questions : (1) How came Tacitus to write in the fluent,
’ᾗ exuberant, rhetorical style 01 1116 Dialogue ἱ) (2) How came he to
abandon it 101 1116 1161110118 energy, the studied brevity, and the

succinctness 01 expression, thought-laden to the verge 01 obscurity,

so characteristic 01 1116 Α1111618 ⁴?

ᾗ We have seen that Tacitus enjoyed a thorough rhetorical training
preparatory to the 101611810 061661 which he had chosen. At the

time when the future historiari began his studies, Quintilian had
already started out on his life—long crusade against the stylist
Seneca by preaching a return to the chaste and classic model 01
ἶ 01613011061611061161106 which he saw typified in Cicero. Now even

if it were not all but certain that the young Tacitus, like his friend

· Pliny, had been a pupil 01 1116 great rhetorician, the treatise 118611

would prove that its author had at all events come under his influ-
ence, 101 80 161 110111 reflecting the stylistic mannerisms 01 Seneca,
v so much affected by the writers 01 1116 111116, 1116 Dialogue displays
not only a profound and extensive acquaintance with the works 01
Cicero, as we shall see, but its very diction is saturated throughout
with Ciceronian phraseology. The documentary evidence 01 11118
1168 116611 collected in the Commentary, and the index locorum s. v.
Cicero will reveal at a glauce the great extent 01 1116 author's

Ciceronian
influence.
