17 plus bilis habeat quam sanguinis: The passionate and veno—
mous character of Severus' oratory is'repeatedly attested. Cf. Sen.

bant homines ne dicentem interpellarent 16 Cassius non continuit

The MSS. read ‘vis,' which Peter, alone of recent editors, defends. The
chief objection against this reading is not the occurrence of ‘vis’ as a
genitive, for this is admitted by the ancient grammarians as a legitimate
form (cf. Neue, Formenl. 12 p, 496 f. Kbhler‚ Acta Sem. Erl. I 390), nor
was Severus devoid of force (see below and Robert, Cass. Sev. p. 49) but
‘vis' and ‘sanguis' are invariably regarded as synonymous. E. g. Quint.
VIII 3, 6 sanguine et viribus niteat X 2, 12 minus virium ac sanguinis
habeant. Peter, intent upon retaining the MS. reading at all hami-ds,
does not shrink from taking ‘vis’ in the sense of ‘nimia vis’! “Dies ·

ergiebt sich‚’' he argues, “aus der mit ‘enim ' angekniipften Erklarung‚ in >

der er (i. e. Severus) ‘incompositus . . . deiectus ’ genannt wird, was neben
dem weiter dazu Gehorigen (! Ρ) nur die Folge einer zu grossen Heftigkeit
und Leidenschaft sein kann.'’ It will be observed‚ that the other adverse
criticisms contained in the ‘enim' clause are significantly ignored. thus
creating the impression that incompositus etc. was directly and closely
attached to the preceding ⁶ vis' as an explanatory clause ! A reading that
can be supported only on such gratuitous assumptions‚ does not call for
serious refutation. Bilis, though less close to the MSS.‚ than ‘viri,‘ is
admirably suited to the context and more properly contrasted with
‘sanguinis‚' both words belonging to the same class of metaphors taken
from the human body. Cp. note c. 21 4 crit. note c. 22 22 and Plin. Ep. IV
11, 2 cui sententiae tantum bilis, tantum amaritudinis inest.

18 contempto ordine rerum: This fault was doubtless in a great
measure due to the remarkable talent of Severus as an extem pora-
neous speaker, which would often render him impatient of
the restrictions imposed by a carefully prepared speech. Cf. Sen.
Contr. III praef. 6 sed cum procedere nollet nisi instructus, liben-
ter ab instrumentis recedebat. ex tempore coactus dicere infinito se
antecedebat. numquam non utilius erat illi deprehendi quam prae-
parari and 4 f. ——omissa modestia ac pudore verborum: The pas-
sage evidently refers to the causticity and scurrility of Severus'
