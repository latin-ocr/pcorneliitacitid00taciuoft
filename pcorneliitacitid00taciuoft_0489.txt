Q. Metellus Celer (see above), the fact that the persons here men-
tioned left written speeches, is known to us only from this passage.
—Peter⁷s unqualified assertion that the author is chiefly indebted
for the above information to Cicero’s Brutus is amazing, in view of
the explicit statement of Tacitus to the contrary that it was taken
from Mucianus (ex his intelleyi potest). — The very intimate knowl-
edge of the history of Roman oratory displayed in this chapter
(see also c. 38 13 ff.) is quite incompatible with the supposition that
the poet Maternus is the speaker, while, on the other hand, it is in
the highest degree appropriate to the historiam Secundus.

13 nec quemquam: In Tac. ‘nec quisquam' is never separated
by an intervening word3 neque q, ⁷·ba1ring three exceptions (H.
IV 61 Ann. III 36 IV 11), always. Cp. Spitta p. 117 Woelfflin,
Philol. XXVII 119.

14 sine aliqua eloquentia· without eloquenee of some kind or
other,' i. e. irrespective of its quality. On this force of ‘aliquis,'
see Seyff-Mi'ill. Lael. p. 199, and on its use after a negative, cf.
note c. 6 7. The thought is a virtual repetition of c. 36 24 f.

birth of the defendants. Cf. Tac. Ag. 6 splendidis natalibus ortam

17 formula: Cf. note c. 20 4.—interdicto: Interdictum is a de-
cree of the praetor calling upon the parties in a suit to conform to
certain injunctions or abstain from doing certain acts. It is, in
particular, either an order of restitution or of production or of
abstention (Restituas, exhibeas, vim fieri veto '). Cp. Smith, Diet.
