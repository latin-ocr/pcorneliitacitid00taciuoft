lxviii PROLEGOMENA.

structions. “ FacunduS‚' in the period under notice, is significantly
enough one of the highest attributes of the poet, while the very
term ‘eloquentia' is made to include all species of poetical com-
position (see c.-1O 13). This being sc, the question must have
presented itself to so analytic an observer as Tacitus admittedly
waS‚ which of these two species of literary composition, poetry or
oratory, was the more important, and hence, before entering upon
a detailed discussion of the causes of the decline of eloquence, he
very appropriately introduces the orator Aper and the poet Maternus
in a preliminary debate concerning the relative superiority of poetry
and eloquence. The problem is purposely left unsolved. Why?
Because it did not admit of a solution, the author clearly perceiv·
ing that in the literature of his day, oratory, so far as it still
flourished, did so only by paying heavy tribute to poetry, while the
latter in its turn wasdistinguished by its oratorical character. In
other words, neither seemed complete without the other; each was
regarded as essential to the other. Viewed in this light, the intro-
ductory chapters become, in my judgment, an integral and organic
part of the dramatic plan of the Dialogue.

Of the four interlocutors, but little in the way of concrete
biographical information is known to us beyond what Tacitus has
thought it sufficient to tell us about them.

Curiatius The host CURIATIUS MATERNUS is introduced to us in the double
Maternus· capacity of a renowned advocate and a tragic poet of great repute.
He seems to have been a native of Gaul, although this is not
certain. He was undoubtedly the oldest in the company, having
scored a pronounced success as the author of a fabula praetextata
in the reign of Nero (c. 11 9). The time when the dialogue is
supposed to have taken place marks a turning point in his career,

as he announces his intention to retire permanently from the forum J
and the bar, in order to devote the rest of his days ‘far from the ⁷

madding crowd's ignoble strife’ to the peaceful cultivation of
the Muses.13⁸

He was very probably no longer living when the Dialogue was
written, for the opinion universally entertained down to very recent
timeS, that he is identical with a sophist of that name executed‘in

138 There is possibly some truth in Baehrens' remark (Comm. C'rit. p. 99)=
ad versus faciendos eum traxit animi mentisque indoles, in forout versaretur
causasque susciperet coegerunt rerum angustiae paupertasque.
