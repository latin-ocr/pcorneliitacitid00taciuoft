logical connecting link between the two propositions ε ² Bassus is a
perfect poet' and ‘no one is a more suitable culpi-it! ‚Again Se-

reum locupletiorem: locuples seems to be a legal term signifying
‘weighty or trustworthy' (Quint. X 1, 67 XII 10, 7 8) and is usually
joined with testis, auctor. With reus : Liv. IX 9, 18 nos sumus rei
satis locupletes. Digest. XII 1, 41 reum locupletem offerre. Of.

tiores esse. Secundus means to say, if poetry is to be accused, then
I know of no more suitable culprit, no more weighty representative
of that art than my friend Bassus. So much the more reason for
my declining to sit in judgment upon a question in which poetry
is involved. -In Aper's ³ Defence of Oratory⁷ which now follows
the author has admirably succeeded in individualising the speaker
both in style and sentiment. , In his fondness for metaphors, ful-
ness of expression, epigrammatic point, conspicuous throughout
Α this speech, Aper stands out in bold relief as a true representative
of the rhetorical eloquence of his time. That this effect is brought
about notwithstanding the fact that the author has repeatedly
appropriated Ciceronian ² motives' and phrases proves, on the one
hand, that Aper’s defence is not strictly historical, and on the
other that Tacitus even in his youth was no servile imitator but an
artist who breathed a new originality even into borrowed material.

expression of Τ. Cf. c. 19 14 et quidquid aliud 35 20 aut quidquid
