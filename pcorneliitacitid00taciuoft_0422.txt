280 NOTES.

Περὶ παίδ. ἀγωγῆς O. 5 δεῖ αὐτὰς τὰς μητέρας τὰ τέκνα τρέφειν καὶ
τούτοις ὑπέχειν τοὺς μαστούς etc. This seems, however, not 130 have
been the general custom either in Greece or Italy. cf. Plut.
Consol. ad uxor. 2 and Friedlander 1454. On the source of this
chapter, see Proleg. pp. xcviii—ciii.—With the expression ³ in gremio,'
etc„ cf. Cic. Brut. 58, 211 legimus epistulas Corneliae matris
Gracchorum: apparet filios non tam in gremio educatos quam in
sermone matris.

‘In’ before ‘ gremio ' has been J'ustly inserted, for the non-repetition of
the preposition in adversative clauses is later Tacitean usage. Cf. notes c.
13 20 and 21 32. —The MS. reading ‘ autem‚' no less than the emendations
‘etiam’ and ‘saltem' do not appear to me in keeping with the context.
The only intelligible meaning that I am able to extract from the passage is,
that the personal supervision of the mother herself is regarded as at all
times desirable, and that only in case she is prevented from taking charge
of the training of her children, may outside aid be called in, the utmost
care being requisite in the choice of the mother's substitute. But this inter-
pretation is only possible, if we read ‘aut elig.' Cp. also John, Fleck. Jahrb.
1888 p. 572 ff. Baehrens, Comm. Urit. p. 84.

16 probatis spectatisque: The metaphor is derived from the
testing of metal or of coinS. Cf. Ter. Eun. III 5, 18 with Donatus'
note oio. verr.'11 3, 78, 181 cv. Trist. 1 5, 25 spectatur in
ignibus aurum Cic. de off. II 11, 38. The same figurative use
occurs in Lucilius ap. Non. 437 tuam probatam mi et spectatam
maxime adulescentiam Cic. de orat. I 27, 124 ceterarum homines
artium ‘spectati et probati and Tac. Ann. XIII 29 experientia
probatos, — Observe the ὕστερον πρότερον in the present passage and
in that from Lucilius.

18 qua sc. propinqua not ‘subole' as Andresen and others con-
tend. For this interpretation, in the first place, interrupts the
sequence of thought and requires the suppression of ‘eiusdem
familiae! That ‘propinqua' is the antecedent of ‘qua' is also
shown by its correlative ³ cuius.' See the discussion of this passage
by John, l. c. and his note ad loc. (Progr. Hall 1892).—neque
dicere ias erat etc: Cf. c. 29 6 aut dicat aut faciat. Sall. Cat. 23,
2. and Liv. XLIII 9 cited below. The collocation is common both
in Greek and in Latin. Cp. Ott0‚ Spriclcwb‘rter etc. p. 112. —On
the precept itself, cf. Xen. Cyr. VII 5, 86 αὐτοί τε γὰρ βελτίονες
ἐσόμεθα, βουλόμενοι τοῖς παισὶν ὥς βέλτιστα παραδείγματα ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς
παρέχειν, οἵ τε παῖδες οὐδ’ ἅν εἷ βούλοιντο ῥᾳδίως πονηροὶ γίγνοιντο,
