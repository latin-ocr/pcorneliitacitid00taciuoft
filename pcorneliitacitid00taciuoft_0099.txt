 

PROLEGOMENA. xcvii

in the note to c. 37 8, was undoubtedly a kind of oratorical anthol-
ogy. If so, it is in the highest degree probable that some other
similar details concerning the orators of the Republic, especially in
those instances in which the Brutus of Cicero could not have been
Tacitus' source, were culled from Mucianus⁷ bandy collection.

To this ² Quelle ' Ι am disposed to assign the interesting passage
in which we are told that the great orators of the Republic de-
livered no speeches before the centumviral court, Pollio's celebrated
speeches for the heirs of Urbinia constituting only an apparent
exception. See note to c. 37 14.

The other passage which, in my judgment, was taken from the
³Acta,' is the close of c. 34, which gives the age at which Crassus,
Caesar, Asinius Pollio and Calvus made their oratorical debut, and
the names of the men whom they prosecuted on that occasion.
For it will not be denied that it is intrinsically improbable to
suppose that Tacitus laboriously collected each single item from
independent and necessarily widely scattered sources, a hypothesis
rendered the more precarious, when it is remembered that our
passage contains two palpable chronological errors, and that one of
these data (concerning Crassus) is given eorreetly by Cicero in the
de oratore‚1³⁸ with which dialogue our author, as we have seen, was
very familiar. The detailed information bears all the marks of
having been due to some compendium or annalistic record of
literary history. Several works of this kind are known to us.
But the Chronica of Nepos were unavailable, because they were
published before 63 B.c., and could not, therefore, have included
Pollio’s speech against C. Cat03 the Annales of Atticus are also
excluded, because they constituted Cicero's source in the de oratore.
The Annales of Fenestella recorded the dates of the speeches of

² celebrated orators, their chronology having already in his day

become confused, as we may infer from a well-known passage in
Gellius.1⁹⁴ Tacitus may, therefore, have been indebted to this
