17 sordes reliquae verborum: Cp: Fronto p. 158 V. sordes

‘Illae,' though yielding a perfecn‘y satisfactory sense, can, nevertheless‚
not be considered as the originalffi‘or it leaves us utterly at a loss to account
for the variant ‘regule’ in AB. I cannot but regard this word (with M.
Sorof) as a corruption of ‘rehq‘uaest due-,to metathesis, a well-known source
of error. The emendation 'lias been objected to on the ground that in the
foregoing nothing had been said of other stylistic blemishes of Caelius,
but this slight inconsistf.ncy is no greater than the similarly illogical use of
‘alius,' on which see crit. note c. 30 26. The subsequent mention of Caelius'
shortcomings had, rioreover, in a measure been foreshadowed by ‘ sive
partes earum.'

hians compositio: compositio like σύνθεσις τῶν ὀνομάτων refers
to the harmonious structure of words and phrases. Cf. Rhet.
ad Heren. IV 12, 18 c. est verborum constructio quae facit omnes
partes orationis aequabiliter perpolitas. In general, it includes the
whole subject of prose rhythm (Quint. IX 4, 1—147). By the addi·
tion of ³ hianS,' the term receives a more restricted meaning, being
equivalent to ‘vocalium or verborum concursus, τῶν φωνηέντων
σύγκρουσις, on which see Quint. VIII 6, 62 and Cic. Orat. 23, 7 7.
44, 151 With Sandys⁷ notes. —inconditi sensus denotes the neglect
'of the laws of rhythm in the periodic structure of sentences (on
this meaning of ³ sensus,⁷ see note c. 20 16). Cp. Sandys, Orat. 9, 32,
44, 149 f. 50, 1693 53, 179 f. Hians and. inconditus are virtually
synonymous with ‘hiulcus, mutilus, fractus, durus, disiunctus,
decurtatUS, concisuS, amputatus' and opposed to ‘aptuS, iunctUS‚
cohaerens, numerosus, suavis, finitus, coagmentatus, adstrictus.'

18 redolent antiquitatem: Cf. Cic. Brut. 21, 82 exiliores oratio-
nes sunt et redolentes magis antiquitatem Macrob. Sat. Ι 5 quid
aliud sermo tuus nisi ipsam redolet vetustatem.

19 antiquarium, a very rare post-August. word. Cf. c. 37 6 42 6
Suet. OctaV. 86 cacozelos et antiquarios. Here equivalent to ‘an-
tiquitatis nimius admirator' (Quint. II 5, 21).

20 propter magnitudinem cogitationum: Vell. Pat. ΙΙ 41, 1
uses the same phrase in his comparison of Caesar and Alexander
the Great.—Pr0pter, as a causa] particle, though common in all
Latin authors, occurs in Tacitus only here 'and in H. Ι 65 propter

Neronem Galbamque pugnaretur, having been entirely superseded ,
by ob in the later writings, an idiosyncrasy imitated by Ammianus·

Marcellinus. Cp. Woelfflin, Archiv Ι 162-169.
21 occupationes rerum: The idiomatic addition of ‘rerum' is
apparently pleonastic, but in reality designed to impart greater
