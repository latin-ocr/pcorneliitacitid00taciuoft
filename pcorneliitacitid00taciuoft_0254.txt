Orig. 19 s. omnis paternorum bonorum. Paul. Sent. 2, 26 s. rei fa-
miliaris, Dictys I 17 8. opum. Dig. 36, 1, 16. It is in such some-
what far-fetched expressions, no less than by the devices pointed
out above, that the stylistic individuality of Aper is brought out
into bold 161161. Translate: ‘Without ample means of subsistence.'
With the thought, cf. Iuv. VII 145 rara in tenui facundia panno.

16 neuter · · - egregius: Cf. Tac. H. II 10 Vibius Crispus . . inter
claros magis quam inter bonos, II 95 successere Mucianus et Mar-
cellus 61 magis alii homines quam alii mores. Eqreqius in Latin
is always used in bonam partem and so quite common in earlier
English and occasionally even in modern writers e. g. Thackeray.
866 the Oxford Dictionary S.v.—a1ter habitu· - corporis contemptus:
The context leaves it entirely uncertain which of the two is intended,
but the passages from Iuv. IV 86 (quoted above) and Statius, Silv.
I 3, 110 Nestorei mitis prudentia Crispi render it highly probable
that Marcellus is meant here.

17 multos iam annos: Doubtless somewhat exaggerated, as usual.
On the position 01 ² iam,' see c. 22 8 and Am. Jour. Phil. XII 447.—
donec = quamdiu with indicative occurs first in Hor. C. I 9, 17,

subj. is found only in orat. obl. Cp. Dr. Η. S. II 615. The particle
is not used at all by Caesar, Sallust, Velleius, and but four times
by Cic.

18 principes in Caesaris amicitia: A peculiarly Tacitean expres-
sion for ‘p. amicorum Caesaris' or εῙ). 111161 C. amicos.' Cf. e. g. Ann.

XIV 51 111 61111110 principis validus XV 50 in animo principis anteibat.
Caesaris=principis, to avoid ambiguity. The reference cannot,
as some have thought, be to Titus or to Domitian, because ‘Caesar'
did not designate the heir apparent or crown prince till the time
of Hadrian. Cp. Mommsen, Ro'm. Staatsr. II 1083 cited by John, ad
loc.— ‘Princeps fori,⁷ also in Quint. XII 11, 3 Domitium Afrum . . .
