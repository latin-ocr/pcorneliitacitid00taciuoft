18 ita not = ² itaque,⁷ as the Lex. Tac. erroneously takes it. See
below—optimus quidem=optimus ille quidem. Cf. note c. 3 8
and crit. note c. 32 30.

19 faciem · -- non imaginem: i. 6. the real countenance not a
mere counterfeit. Cf. Cic. Orat. 3, 9 perfectae eloquentiae speciem
animo videmus, effigiem auribus quaerimus Tusc. Disp. III 2, 3
consectaturque nullam eminentem effigiem virtutis, sed adumbra-
tam imaginem gloriae Quint. X 2, 11 necesse est minus sit eo
quod imitatur, ut umbra corpore et imago facie Apul. Met. 10, 27
111111161 . . . supprimens faciem, praetendens imaginem.

20 rudibus: rudis is a foil or perhaps a wooden stick used in
fencing exercises. In a figurative sense also in Cic. de opt. gen. 6,
17 11011 6111111 111 6616 versatur (sc. Isocrates) ct ferro sed quasi
rudibus eius eludit oratio. Tacitus, as often, omits the apologetic
particle.

‘sed,' the reading 01 0111 MSS. is unintelligible and probably arose out
01 the wrong solution 01 6 compendium. ⁴ Sic‚' followed by ⁴ ut,' is cor-
related to ‘ita' above. ‘ In this way, there lacked not— thus it was that!
An original ‘nec ' would scarcely have been corrupted into ⁶ sed.'

’21 auditorium · - · 611 invidis et faventibus: The prepositional
phrase, denoting the material out of which an audience is com-
posed, is here joined as an attributive directly to the substantive.
Cf. e. g. Tac. H. IV 7 6 11111165 6556 Ceriali nisi 6 reliquiis Germanici
exercitus legiones Cic. in Verr. II 4, 27, 62 pocula ex auro Liv.
Ι 34 611 virtute nobilitas, and so often with other prepositions as
‘a, de, sine! Usually, however, some verb such as ‘compositus,
mixtus, constitutus' is added. Ε. g. Tac. H. IV 37 mixtus ex
Chattis Usipis Mattiacis exercitus 79 (6011015) 611 Chaucis Frisiis·
que composita. The present instance is particularly noteworthy,
because the prepositional clause is added as an attributive adJ'ec·
tive, a collocation apparently found only with ‘ sine,’ on which see

note c. 32 21.

‘ Semper novum ' is, in my judgment‚ an interpolation, for this epithet
was, 01 6011156, quite as applicable to the audiences 01 the speaker’s own
day as to those 01 the Republic. Hence the phrase has no place in the
present context, which deals only with points 01 differenoe between the two
periods. This suspicion derives strong external support from the fact that
the MS. variants (p. 45) also unmistakably point to a supralinear gloss
which subsequently intruded into the text in different places.

22 1166 bene nec male dicta dissimularentur: With ‘nec bene,'
understand in thought ‘ simularentur' i. e. the praiseworthy utter-
