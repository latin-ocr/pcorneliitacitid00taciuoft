180 NOTEs.

Tacitus and other writers (see note c. 15 1) and hence ‘quosdam '
and ‘olim natos' were here added in order to define ‘antiquos' more
closely, ‘ veteres' alone not being sufficient for this purpose. Cp. Peter
ad loc. On the relative meaning of these terms, see also Cic. Brut.
10, 39 At ii quidem, ut populi Romani aetas est, senes, ut Atheni-
ensium saecula numerantur, adulescentes debent videri 41 Themis-
tocles ut apud nos, perantiquus, ut apud Athenienses, non ita sane
vetus, and on their application to the writers of the pre-Augustan
period, cf. Quint. X 1, 40 with Mayor's (and Peterson's) note p. 96.

19 Ulixes ac Nestor: The eloquence of Nestor was proverbial
throughout antiquity, his oratorical reputation being based upon
the famous line in the Iliad, B 249 τοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ γλώσσης μέλιτος
γλυκίων ῥέεν αὐδή (transl. by Auct. ad Heren. IV 33, 44 Cic. de sen.
10, 31). Cf. also Theogn. 714 Γλῶσσαν ἔχων ἀγαθὴν Νέστορος ἅντι-
θέου. Sen. Ep. 40, 2. Plin. Ep. IV 3, 3 Laus Pis. 64 Inclita Nestorei
cedit tibi gratia mellis Tertull. de anim. 31 quem forsitan Nestorem
credidissemus ob mella facundiae Auson. Prof. 16, 22, 22 Et mel-
litae nectare vocis 1 Dulcia fatu verba canentem Nestora regem.
See Otto, Die Spriehw. ete. bei d. Rem. p. 242. — On the eloquence
‘Of odysseus, Cf. Iliad Γ 222 καὶ ἔπεα νιφάδεσσιν ἐοικότα χειμερίῃσιν
Ov. Met. XIII 92 facundus Ulixes. Cicero in the Brutus l. c., also
mentions Odysseus and Nestor together as the oldest representa—
tives of Greek eloquence. ‘Neque enim iam Troicis temporibus
tantum laudis in dicendo Ulixi tribuisset Homerus et Nestori . . .
nisi iam tum esset honos eloquentiae. — mille fere et trecentis annis
·· · antecedit: The siege of Troy, according to the calculation of
Eratosthenes, which was the one generally accepted in antiquity,
lasted from 1193—1184. Adding 75 to the 1193, which year Aper
selects for the reasons given below, we get 1268, or in round num-
bers 1300 years as the interval between the really ancient Homeric
orators and those of the speaker’s own age. ——fere in Tacitus occurs
only here, c. 20 2 31 7 39 6 and H. IV 60, being entirely replaced
by ‘ferme’ in the later works.

20 Demosthenes etc: Demosthenes was born 384 B. C. and died
on the 10th day of Pyanepsion (z Oct. 12) 322. Hyperides, the date
of whose birth is unknown, was put to death by Antipater, just one
week previous. Philip of Macedon was born in 382, ascended the
throne in 359, and was assassinated by Pausanias in 336. Alexander

was born July 21, 356, and died May, 323.
