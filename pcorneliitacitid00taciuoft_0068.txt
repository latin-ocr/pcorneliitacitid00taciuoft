16 8, the reasons for the decadence in question, by pointing out
that it is in a measure due to the lack of opportunity for the
display of eloquence, unsettled political conditions, such as existed
in democratic Athens and republican Rome, affording a more favor-
able soil for the growth ofssoratory, than the regulated order of
things found under a monarchidal government.

Maternus, in summing up the debate, brings about a reconcilia?
tion by observing that the differences between the ancient and
modern types of eloquence are indeed historically conditioned on
the one hand, but on the other not due to any intellectual inferi-
ority of contemporary speakers, for which reason we should take
things as we find them and make the most of the opportunities
which one’s own age unquestionably offers in satisfactory abun—

os c.1-13. manifest unity of plan will seem to have been very seriously
destroyed, if it be true that the first thirteen chapters, dealing with
the respective superiority of poetry and oratory, are a mere intro·

vielleicht der 'ubrigen Thatigkeiten eines otium litteratum Ξ ?) den

Theiles des Dialogs bildet und die Maternus am Schlusse entschei-
dend lost (??)‚ sie ist der eigentliche Gegenstand der gesammten
Schrift !'' ¹3²
