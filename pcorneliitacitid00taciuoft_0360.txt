With the possible exception of Caes. B. G. VI 30 aedificio circumdato
silva, ut sunt fere domicilia, neither ‘fere ’ nor ‘ferme,' the form preferred
by Tac. in his later writings, ever directly modifies a substantive, not even
when it signifies ‘ ut plerumque fit, ut fieri solet,' on which see note c. 31, 7.
Taking this in connection with the remarkable parallel passage from Quint.
Just cited, I have had no hesitation in inserting ‘ omnia.’ The archetypon
had cu, which either stood for ‘ omnia ' as in c. 2 14 13 15 or was possibly a
remnant of an original ‘cuncta,' but as the compendium was not under-
stood by the scribe, the syllable was dropped. So similarly in Quint. X 1,
106 omnia, though essential to the context, is omitted in some MSS.
Perhaps the passage in Caesar is only another case in point.

3 quinque in Verrem libros expectabit: Aper sophistically ignores
the fact that Cicero actually delivered only one speech in court
Α against Verres (Aug. 5, 70 B. o.), the others having been, as is well
known, subsequently composed.

There are in all sia: speeches against Verres, but Aper, according to our
MSS„ mentions only five, excluding‚ as is expressly or tacitly assumed by
the commentators, the Actio Prima. But in doing so, Aper would be virtu-
ally confessing that he was well aware of the purely literam character of the
other five, which cannot possibly have been his intention, for is his censure
was to have any foundation at all, it was clearly essential to speak of all the
six extant orations as having been actually delivered, and this I believe he
did. The archetypon had either VIINVERREM or vunverrem, which
reading, owing to the graphical identity of the numeral and the letter ‘i'
following, caused the evident corruption now existing.
