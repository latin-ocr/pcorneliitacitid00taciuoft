recently deceased. He remained on intimate terms with Domitian,
as has been justly inferred from an anecdote in Suet. Domit. 3.
His wealth was proverbial (Mart. IV 54, 7 divitior Crispo) and
estimated at 2ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sesterceS„acc. to the schol. Iuv. 1. c. or
300,000,000 according to Tacitus. The scholiast may, however, have
mistaken Vibius Crispus for Crispus Pasienus Tac. H. II 10
characterises him as ‘pecunia potentia ingenio inter claros magis
quam inter bonos,' in perfect agreement with the statements in the
Dial. c. 8 and 13. Juvenal, writing some thirty years after his
death, is more favorably disposed toward him ‘Venit et Crispi

mite [ingenium. Regarding the power of his eloquence, there seems
to have been no difference of opinion. Quint. V 13, 48 X 1, 119
XII 10, 11 gives it the complimentary epithet of iucundus, also
applied to him by Iuv. 1. c. Cf. Nipp. Ann. XIV 28 Mayor, ad
Iuv. IV 81-93 and in Addenda Vol. Ι p. 407 f. 414. On the trans-

the Silver Age, particularly common in Tacitus. In the Dial.

minus has justly been regarded as corrupt, Peter alone defending it
by an interpretation of esse which is quite untenable. Minus arose out of
a wrong solution of a compendium (mm). On minor in the sense of
‘inferior in rank, renown, intellect,' cf. c. 21 24 Ann. I 13 Gallum Asinium

5 ubi nati dicuntur: Aper does not wish to be understood as
saying that the birthplace of Marcellus and of Crispus was at all
uncertain, for it was not, but that their world-wide fame made it a
matter of indifference, where they might happen to have been
born. Cp. the famOus remark of Pericles in Thucyd. II 43, 15
ἀνδρῶν γὰρ ἐπιφανῶν πᾶσα γῆ τάφος. —ter milies: The phrase from
Martial, quoted above, as well as the fact that Capua refers to Mar-
cellus, whose name precedes that of Crispus in the beginning of
