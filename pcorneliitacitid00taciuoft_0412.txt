‘detectus' ‘exposed himself to attack' is also suited to the context3
it avoids the absolute use of ⁶ deiectus ’ and retains the metaphor. But as
no trace of a variant appears in the MSS„ 1 see no reason for reJ'ecting the
traditional reading. Baehrens objects to ‘detectus' on the ground that
the word never occurs in the sense 'of “intectusff This is very true, for
‘intego' has exactly the opposite meanfiig!

20 non pugnat sed rixatur: Puqna is a battle in which the com-
batants are properly trained3 rima an ordinary quarrel that comes
to blows. Of. Liv. II 18 rixa ac prope proelium fuit Quint. ΙΙ 12, 2
gladiator armorum inscius in rixam ruit. It is used of a ranting
orator also in Quint. XI 1, 29 videas autem rixatores quosdam.
Both the noun and the verb are extremely rare in Cicero. Cf. Verr.
II 4, 66, 148 turba atque rixa de orat. II 59, 240 rixatus, where see
Wilkins. The same criticism is applied to Calvus by Fronto Ep. ·
p. 114 N. Calvus rixatur. For numerous other points of resem-
blance between him and Severus, see the discussion in P. Robert
op. cit. p. 66-68.——eeterum: ‘But to return to my statement con-
cerning Severus ³ viz. posse oratorem vocari. For a similar use of
²ceterum,⁷ where ‘ad personam regreditur oratio' cf. G. 43 valen·
tissimas (sc. gentes) nominasse sufficiet, Harios . . . ceterum Harii
and Ann. II 34 Urgulania . . . ceterum Urgulania. ² Ceterum' after
a digression: Gr. 3 Η. II 21 III 35.

21 sequentibus···ceteros: The two terms refer to the same
persons, The tautology is, however, excusable, being probably
occasioned by the necessity of joining an accusative with ‘ superat!
—varietate eruditionis: ‘varied culture.’ Cf. c. 19 5 nec inscitia
litterarum.

22 lepore urbanitatis: ‘charming wit.' Cf. Cic. de orat. I 5, 17
lepos . . . eruditio . . . urbanitate coniuncta, with Wilkins' notes.
¹ urbanitatis⁷ is apparently only added for the sake of the libration.
—virium robore: This collocation is especially frequent in Livy:
e. g. XXII 40 XXIII 26 XXIV 48 XXVII 46 XXXIII 4. Curt.
VII 3, 4. virium is here perhaps best taken in the figurative
sense of ‘mental forces,' thus retaining the military metaphor so
carefully sustained throughout this paragraph—This favorable
view of the oratorical talent of Severus is, in spite of sundry
adverse criticism‚ fully shared by Sen. Contr. ΙΙΙ praef. 3 tantun-
dem erat in homine quantum in ingenio and by Quint. X 1, 116
multa, si cum iudicio legatur, dabit imitatione digna Cassius Severus
qui, si ceteris virtutibus colorem et gravitatem orationem adiecisset,
ponendus inter praecipuos foret. nam ingenii plurimum est in eo.
