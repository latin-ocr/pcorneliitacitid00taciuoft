and ³ tabularia' (c. 39 5), rather proves, that we have not yet
reached an ideal state, though we may admit that a more regulated
order of things now prevaiIs.

The emendation ‘antiqui . . . fori’ is eminently satisfactory, being both
easy and admirably suited to the meaning called for by the context.
Andresen, following B'rotier and Ritter‚ inserts ‘ ex’ before ‘antiquis' and
deletes ‘forum ' or ‘horum’ of the MSS. Nothing can be more unJ'ustifi-
able on methodical grounds. Andresen refers in his latest edition to his
Emend. p. 134, but nothing more than the mere conJ'ecture itself is there
given. Apart from the manifest inferiority of his reading to the one
adopted in the text, I have serious doubts, whether ‘superest ex aliquo’
can be supported by parallel passages, nor do I, in any case, understand
what is meant by ‘what is left of ancient orators'! Maternus is speaking
of conditions, not of individuals. —‘superest antiquis oratoribus forum,’
accepted by some, absurdly implies that, in the speaker's opinion, there
were still orators of the old type (ι Redner des alten Schlages') remaining,
a point refuted by the entire treatise.

2 emendatae· · - compositae: The same collocation is found in
Sen. Ep. 4, 1 emendato animo et composito,

’3 advocat: ‘to call in as a (3011118οΙ101- in a trial.’ This legal
term, though common, does not occur elsewhere in Tac—nocens
aut miser: Of. Tac. Ann. Ι 22 innocentibus et miserrimis—nocens
as a subst. also H. I 21; miser, H. IV 81 Ann. XI 37.

II 3, 52,122 agros . . . vexatos atque exinanitos . . . populatam
vastatamque provinciam Liv. XL 35, 10 provincia spoliaretur.—
With the thought cf. Tac. Ag. 19 Iuv. VIII 87-123 esp. 98 f. non
idem gemitus olim neque vulnus erat par Ι damnorum sociis floren-
tibus et modo victus and, in general, Mayor, Iuv. 11. cc. Mai-quardt
Staatsv. II 103, 1 Friedlander 1⁶ 258 ff.—The entire passage ‘quis
etc.' is intended to offset the glowing description of Secundus c.
36 19 f., where see notes—atqui melius fuisset non queri quam
vindicari: The indicative with expressions like ι111011118, satis,
longum est,' is the rule3 exceptions are, however, occasionally met
with. E. g. Rhet. ad Her. IV 26, 36 non igitur satius esset Cic.
de sen. 23, 82 nonne multo melius fuisset Sen. de ben. V 25, 3
indicare melius fuisset Tac. H. II 2 haud fuerit (potential) longum
