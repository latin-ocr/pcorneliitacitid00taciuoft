explanation ‘they appropriate everything to themselves, thus
acquiring their immense wealth at the expense of others,' mis-
interprets Aper’s attitude toward these two men. For analo-
gous passages, see Liv. III 37 ferre agere plebem plebisque res
and. Xen. Cyr.III 3,2 πάντες ὑπήντων ἡδόμενοι τῇ εἰρήνῃ καὶ φέροντες καὶ
ἄγοντες ὅ τι ἕκαστος ἄξιον εἶχε, and Tac. H. I 2, 19 (delatores) agerent
verterent cuncta. Observe that the usual order of this collocation
common both in Greek and Latin, is here reversed. So also Homer
E 484 Arist. Nub. 243 Xen. Hell. VI 5, 50. Such variation is very
characteristic of Tacitus, who seeks to add a touch of novelty to
expressions which had become stereotyped by constant usage.
Cf. Ann. XIV 38 igni atque ferro for the regular ³ ferro ignique.’

19 cum quadam: In the Dial., the anastrophe of the preposition
is habitually avoided (see c. 22 13 cum quodam lumine), except in
formulaic expressions such as eaque de re (c. 2 4) quem ad modum
(c. 33 7) magna ex parte (c. 35 12) and the like. Cp. A. Gerber,

20 venerabilis senex et patientissimus veri: Vespasian was at
the time in which this conversation is alleged to have taken place
(74-75 A.D.), 65 years old, having been born on the 17 th of No-
vember 9 A.D.—As Marcellus and Crispus are represented in c.
13 15 as ‘adligati omni adulatione nec imperantibus umquam satis
servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi,⁷ it will be plain, even if we
make all due allowance for Maternus’ unfriendly attitude, that
“ patientissimus veri' cannot refer to the παῤῥησία of these two men
toward their sovereign. The praise of Vespasian seems to be
introduced simply by way of apology for openly characterising his
all-powerful friends as the real power behind the throne, a criticism
which even so mild-tempered a ruler might be liable to resent.
Vespasian⁷s great tolerance of outspokenness is well attested by
Suet. Vesp. 13 Amicorum libertatem, causidicorum figuras ac philoso-
phorum contumaciam lenissime tulit and Eutr. VII 13 Offensarum
et inimicitiarum immemor fuit. Convicia a causidicis et philoso-
phis in se dicta tulit—Aper would have had no scruples in sub-
scribing to Seneca's dictum (de ira III 36): vide non tantum an
verum sit, quod dicis, sed an ille cui dicitur veri patiens sit. Cf.
also the close of his speech (c. 10).

‘ ἐρεῖθ’ has been changed into ‘ipsi ' by Lipsius, which destroys the con-
trast indicated by ‘ et alios.' Et after ‘ eeteros ’ is quite out of place, and is
