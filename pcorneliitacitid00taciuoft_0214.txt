72 NOTES.

9 Maternus: The speaker uses his own name in place of> a
personal pronoun by way of strong emphasis. It is a kind of
enallage and occurs as early as Homer, Iliad 16, 496 ὄτρυνον Λυκίων
ἄνδρας Σαρπήδονος ἀμφιμάχεσθαι. Plut. Cat. Min. 993 c. Cf. also H.
II 47 Othonem posteritas aestimet ‚7 7 ne Mucianum socium spre-
veris. Hor. Epod. XV 12 si quid iii Flacco viri est. Verg. Aen.
V 353 Niso digna dabis. Shakespeare, Jul. CaeS. ‘When Brutus
grows so covetous,’ ‘Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius!
Sometimes the demonstrative pronoun is so used, e. g. Cic. pro
Arch. 1 haec vox (= mea) Prop. II 7, 7 hoc caput—The meaning
of this much disputed passage is this z You will understand, when
you read (leges=legendo intelleges, cf. Plin. Ep. VII 19, 7 illas
[sc. feminas] quae leguntur, aptly cited by Peter) the published
tragedy, what duty a man, such as I, owes to his eonvietions and
you will recognise the sentiments which you heard me recite. In
fact, my new tragedy Thyestes will supplement such utterances
as my Cato may have omitted.

Nipperdey's emendation ‘leges' inquit ‘si libuerit,' accepted by mos't
editors, lacks all palaeographical probability, as Halm, Rh. Mus. XXVIII

p. 499 f. has shown, nor can any motive ever have induced a scribe to insert
‘ Maternus' which Nipperdey and his followers are forced to regard as an

interpolation. The obJ'ection‚ morecver, that leges cannot be followed by
an indirect question, for it was this that prompted the emendation, rests
upon a wrong interpretation of this verb. Finally it may be added, that
libuerit in any case decidedly weakens the force of the passage, at the
same time implying the absurd idea that Maternus' friends might possibly
not care to read the Cato when published (Halm l. c.). Greef's conjecture
⁶ intelleges' is ingenious and palaeographically highly probable‚ but in view
of the above explanation of leges not absolutely necessary.

11 Thyestes: Not the hero Thyestes but Agamemnon in the
tragedy of that name, as appears clearly from c. 9 6 cui bono si
apud te Agamemnon aut Iason diserte loquitur. The Medea and
Thyestes are the only Greek tragedies attributed to MaternuS‚ who
in c. 12 ext. significantly singles out the Thyestes of Varius and
Ovid’s Medea as the most admired dramas in Roman literature.
This suggests the possibility that these two famous plays may
have constituted the models of Maternus’ own dramas. It should
also be noticed, that inasmuch as Agamemnon played an impor-
