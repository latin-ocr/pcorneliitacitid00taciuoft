C. 37. 349

Schiller: Es wachst der Mensch mit seinen hoheren Zwecken.—
Andresen translates ‘vis ingenii' by ‘Darstellungsvermogen.’ I
can see no warrant for this rendering, either in the context or in
the phrase itself.

22 claram et inlustrem: Also grouped in Cic. de rep. VI 11
inlustri et claro quodam loco de div. II 3, 8 exempla clara et
inlustria Plin. Ep. VI 29, 3 claras et inlustres (sc. causas). Of.
also Quint. X 1, 67 clarius inlustraverunt.—On the repetition
‘inlustrem . . . inlustrant,⁷ see note c. 1 8.

24 nec = ‘ nec ideo.’ So often in a conclusion. Cf. e. g. c. 12 13.

‘opinor' is generally used with a tinge of irony, and thus distin-
guished from ‘ut opinor.² Op. Anton, Studien ΙΙ 186, cited to c.
32 27. ——Demosthenem orationes ‘inlustrant quas adversus tutores
composuit: Demosthenes began* his suit against his guardians
(Aphobus, Demophon, and Therippides) in 363 B. c., at the age of
twenty-one. He obtained a verdict against them, but eventually
secured but a small amount of his patrimOny. Of these so-called
ἐπιτροπικοὶ λόγοι, five speeches, partly supposititious, have come
down 130 US, viz. κατὰ Ἀφόβου, I. Π. πρὸς *Αφοβον ψευδομαρτυριῶν
Φάνῳ, πρὸς Ὀνήτορα ἐξούλης Ῑ. Π. The ill-success Of these early
attempts of the orator is sneeringly alluded to by Aesch., Ctesiph.

173 τὰ πατρῷα καταγελάστως προέμενος. Cp. alSO Plut. Dem. O. 6.——- ’

Secundus probably spoke of some of the more famous speeches of
Demosthenes, in the portion now lost, so that it was not necessary
to complete the antithesis here, the more so, as he was chiefly
intent on illustrating his argument by Roman examples.—Peter
remarks that ‘ composuit’ not ² habuit' is used, because the speaker
has in mind the extant written speeches and the reputation which
they even at the present day possess, but in that case we should
also expect ‘circumdant' in place of ‘oi1·eumdederunt.’—On the
ellipsis of the demonstrative pronoun (eas), cf. note c. 32 8.

26 P. Quintius defensus: The earliest speech of Cicero, delivered
in 81 B. c., in his twenty-sixth year.—On the use of the perf. pass.
participle for an abstract noun, see note c. 29 12. —cmt = et, hence
