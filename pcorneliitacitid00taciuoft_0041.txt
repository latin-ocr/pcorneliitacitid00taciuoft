 

PROLEGOMENA. xxxix

Maternus, like TacituS, sincerely acquiesces in the monarchical
regime for reasons of expediency, for the existing state of affairs
is still far from realising his political ideals. He willingly
concedes the truth of Secundus⁷ statement that eloquence found
more favorable conditions of growth in the more turbulent times
,of republican Rome, but being firmly resolved to forsake the
irksome duties of the forum, which had become repugnant to him,
he maintains that the blessings of peace and tranquillity, possible
only under the government of a single ruler, more than counter-
balance the oratorical superiority of the republican period. If
called upon to choose between anarchy and oratorical decadence,
he would prefer the latter as the lesser of two evilsfl

Eloquence, like fire, requires fuel to feed it and motion to fan it
into a blaze, in fact, any intense literary activity is incompatible
with political tranquillity. This observation embodies a truth so
profound, and one so far removed from mere commonplace plati-
tude, that Ι cannot believe it to have occurred to two writers
independently of each other, and when we find to our surprise that
the same thought is met with in but one other passage in extant
literature, namely the— Histories of =Tacitus, only blind prejudice
can fail to see the important bearing which this parallelism has
upon the question of authorship.⁵5

The author of the Dialogue, like Tacitus, deplores the loss of
freedom of speech, and the risks incurred by giving voice to one's
convictions are alluded to by both.56

But the striking coincidences do not end here. Maternus, in
opposition to Aper's admiring comments, has nothing but supreme
contempt for the abject servility of informers and ‘amici principis'

adsidua senatus tranquillitas et maxime principis disciplina ipsam quoque

potest magnam famam et magnam quietem and Tac. H. I 1 postquam bellatum
apud Actium atque omnem potentiam ad unum conferri pacis interfuit, mayna
illa inqenia cessere. A similar idea, with special reference to the development
of dramatic poetry, has been well brought out by J. A. Symonds‚ Studies of the
Greek Poets II p. 11 ff.
