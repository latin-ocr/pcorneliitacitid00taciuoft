278 ⁴ NOTES.

the demonstrative pronoun in Tacitus, see the numerous examples
in Lex, Tac. s, v. and note c. 12 9. Cp. also Cic. ad Att. X 11, 3
sunt tolerabilia . . . hac iuventute. -P7·0priu3, without a genit. or
dative, often expresses a specificidea as opposed to a more general
statement. So in Tac. Ann. II 77 ‘propria mandata XV 74 tum
dona et grates deis decernuntur propriusque honos soli. See Peter's
note ad loc., who takes his=nostris, on the analogy of 0. 32 13
huius quoque cotidiani sermoniS, an interpretation not essentially
different from the one given.

There is certainly no valid reason for departing from the MS. reading.
⁶ eius ' no less than ‘ huius ’ (sc. urbis) would be tautological by the side of
‘ vernaculis,’ on which see following note.

vernaculis ·-—- ‘native Roman.⁷ Cf. Nipp. to Tac. Ann. I 31 verna-
cula multitudo (= ἀστικὸς ὄχλος in Dio CaSS. LVII 5, 4) nuper acto
in urbe dilectu, Heraeus to Tac. H. II 88 vernacula utebantur

urbanitate, and Varr. L. L. V 77 aquatilium vocabula partim sunt '

vernacula partim pereqrina Mart. X 76, 4 de plebe Remi Numae-
que verna, on which word Festus remarks: Romanos vernas appel·

, labant, id est ibidem natos.

10 vitiis: Here personified, as in Ov. Am. III 4, 11 vitia inritare
vetando. —- natos—-liberi is a poetic word and very rare in classical
prose, where it is always joined to ‘parentes' or similar expres·
sions. Cf. Cic. Lael. 8, 27 Liv. I 23, 1 V 40, 3 viri natique C. I.
L. II 2900 mariti et nati. Alone as here, also Val. Max. VII 6 ext.
and a few times in the Church Fathers. Cp. A. Funk, ‘ Was heis-sen·
die Kinder ? ’ in Archiv VII 73-102 (on nati p. 86), who strangely
overlooked the fact that well-nigh all the Latin designations for
‘ offspring' occur in this and the following chapter. Cf. liberi (l. 12),
filius, (l. 13), suboles (l. 17) pueri (l. 20), infans (c. 29 1) parvuli (l. 7).
Το these we may add from Tac. ‘pignora' (Ag. 38 G. 7 Ann. XII 2
XV 36 XVI 26) and ‘ puerperia ' (Ann. XII 6).

11 cumulantur: Observe the abandonment of the figure intro-
duced by ² quae . . . excipiunt,' and see note c. 10 21. —prius· · -
praedixero: For the pleonasm, cf. note c. 18 7. —severitate ac
disciplina: Hendiadys as shown by c. 29 17 H. I 51 severitate di·
sciplinae. Cf. also c. 40 9 severissima disciplina Ann. VI 15
severa patris disciplina. The same collocation, but in inverted

order, occurs in l. 24 G. 25 Bell. Alex. 48.
12 circa with a gerundive occurs a number of times in Quintilian

e. g. IV 1, 9. 7, 36 VI 2, 25 and occasionally in other post-Aug.
