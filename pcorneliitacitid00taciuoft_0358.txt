that ‘per quae' is not strictly used for the instrumental ablative,
as in c. 24 5, where see note, but in its original local sense with an
accusative of extent, here facilitated by its antecedent ‘itineribus'
So similarly c. 29 8 per quae . . . inrepit c. 32 8 per . . . numeros
isse H. IV 7 per altercationem . . . pfiovecti sunt, the metaphor being
taken from verbs expressing motion. This usage is poetic and
post-Aug. Cf. Peterson, Quint. X 5, 21.

23 vi et potestate, non iure et legibus: It cannot have been Aper's
intention to assert, as might perhaps appear at first sight, that the
monotony and prolixity of former speeches were in his day partly
done away with, because the modern judge no longer presided with
equity and fairness, but substituted in their place arbitrariness and
despotic authority. Such a change would not have been a creditable
achievement of the new era which the speaker wishes to place in
as advantageous and favorable a light as possible. Hence Aper can
only be understood to mean, that modern judges did not allow
themselves to be tied down to the letter of the laW, but occasionally
followed their own interpretation, enforcing it by the authority
, vested in their office. See also following note. Peter who, alone
of the commentators, seems to have felt any difficulty here,
supposes Aper to refer to the trials presided over by the princeps
himself whose decisions were, of course, not necessarily influenced
by law or precedent, but this is intrinsically improbable for the
reason just given, nor is there anything in the context that lends
itself readily to so restricted an application of Aper’s words. —Vis
is power generally, potestas the particular authority of a magistrate.
