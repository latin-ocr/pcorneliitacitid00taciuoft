f. One of the most noticeable features 01 the style of Tacitus,
when compared with that 01 post-Augustan prose-writers, is his
peculiar predilection for alliterative 601111111161310115.99 It is, there-

fore, 01 the highest significance in the present discussion to observe Ἰ

the same fondness for alliteration in the Dialogus, See ³ Style and
‘Language'

The failure 01 50 many scholars from Lipsius to Andresen to ²,
recognise any resemblance between the style 01 the historian 2

Tacitus and that met with in our treatise was primarily due to the
deplorable fact that the Histories and more particularly the Annals

were taken as the sole criterion and standard 01 comparison. In the
later works, Tacitus, like Thucydides, seemed, 11 we may appropriate -.

the language of Quintilian, ‘densus et brevis et semper instans,'

⁹⁷ Cp. also the remarks 01 Kaibel, Stil und Text der Πολ. Ἀθην. des
Aristoteles p. 50 with the passage from Soph. Elect. 580 ff. there cited.
98 Half a dozen instances excepted, all of the illustrations 01 Tacitean usage

given under α. b. c. d. e. are omitted in Weinkauff’s collection pp. cxxxviii—clxiv!

⁹⁹ This peculiarity did not escape his later imitator, Ammianus Marcellinus.
