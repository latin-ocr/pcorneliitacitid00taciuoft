. not help thinking that nature had rather marked him out for a

·Ῑ scholar than for the active and less peaceful vocation of an advo-

, cate, and hence we are not surprised to learn that he also devoted

2 himself to historical research, and had published an admirable

‘s biography of Julius Africanus (c. 14 21 f.). ’

¹ In the present mutilated condition of the Dialogue, Secundus
scarcely figures as an interlocutor at all. But that the author did
assign to him a much larger share in the conversation seems to me

indisputable. For the conspicuous manner of his introduction, the

‘i careful description of the oratorical characteristics of himself and

·· Aper, with whom he is placed upon a perfect footing of equality,
= finally, the-very phrase of the prooemium, ² cum sinquli . . . causas
adferrent,' no less than the words in c. 16 8, pro duobus promitto: -
nam et ego et Secundus exsequemur eas partes etc.,14⁸ render the
> supposition that the author had nevertheless condemned him to
silence throughout the debate quite inconceivable. But whether
j his contribution to the discussion was lost in the large lacuna after
c. 35, which has been the opinion of some scholars, or whether we
still possess part of it in the speech ccmmonlyassigned to Maternus,

, is quite another and more difficult question, which we shall endeavor

’ἓ to answer at the close of the chapter.

,, 14⁸ This unequivocal and positive promise of a speech by Secundus is quite
ῗ generally set aside as worthless, but Tacitus was under no compulsion to make

a purposeless statement, nor does an artist introduce a ⁴ motive ’ merely for the
' sake of abandoning it at pleasure. It has also strangely been argued that
“” Secundus' want of oratorical facility may well account for his not appearing as
’Δ an interlocutor. But this explanation utterly ignores the fact that the author
ᾖξε expressly attributes what he regards as an unjust accusation, to the maliynity
’ ’ξ’ of some critics. If so, he had the more reason for exhibiting Secundus as a
J fluent speaker instead of virtually confirming the charge by allowing him to
ί remain silent l

¹⁵³ This is made evident not only by c. 28 9 vestra vobis notiora sunt: ego

de urbe et his propriis ac vernaculis vitiis loquar, but also by the fact that

ing Messalla, designates the orators of the Roman republic as maiores tuos

(c. 27 e).
