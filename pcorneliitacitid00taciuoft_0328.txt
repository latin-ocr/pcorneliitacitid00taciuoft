Ciceronis in hunc diem colliguntur? As the dates of the completed
reigns are indisputably historica] (cp. Violet, Leipz. stud. V p. 172.
186 f. 219. 229), the error was supposed to lurk in the date of
Vespasian's still incompleted reign. The various attempts at
emendation are enumerated on p. 21ῖ4 They are all intrinsically or
palaeographically improbable, and have consequently met with no
favor save in the eyes of their respective authors. Nor does the
interpretation of sextam ³ sixthly’ proposed by Steiner p. 17 note 33
and revived by Kleiber p. 45-48 merit serious attention, as J ansen
and others have shown. The great majority of critics have accord-
ingly taken ‘centum et viginti' as a round number. Cp. Eckstein,
Proleq. p. 36 Jansen p. 11-18 Violet p. 230 John, Correspbl. p. 25 ff.
Peter ad loc. This supposition 18, however, also open to grave
objections (1) 1f Aper was satisfied with a round number, the
carefully elaborate enumeration was wholly out of place. (2) It is
not probable that, if ‘centum et viginti anni' was intended as a
round number, the author would have employed still another round
number, side by side, in reference to this very passage, as he does in
ἱ 0. 25 ext. centum. et viqinti annos ab interitu Cic. etc. in hunc diem
effici ratio temporum collegerit and c. 26 4 quos satis constat ante
centum annos fuisse. I am convinced that the alleged difficulty is
imaginary, being based upon the erroneous assumption that the
words ‘centum et viginti etc.² solely express the sum total of a
preceding enumeration, for this is so far from being the case,
that the very opposite holds good. In other words, the sentence
¹ centum . . . aetas ' is in reality tlte pivotal point upon which. Aper's
entire aryumentation rests, the enumeration of reigns from Augustus
to Vespasian being brought in solely for the purpose of verification.
This interpretation would doubtless have been suggested long
ag0, had not the very existence of the Roman belief that 120 years
constituted the limits of a inan⁷s lifetime been overlooked. The
indisputable evidence upon this point, so far as it has come under
my observation, is furnished by the following passages: Treb.
Poll. Vita Claud. 2 Doctissimi mathematicorum CENTUM ET VIGJNTI
Annos HOM1N1 An VIVENDUM DA'ros iudicant neque amplius cuiquam
iactitant esse concessos, etiam illud addentes, Mosen solum dei, ut
Iudaeorum libri locuntur, familiarem CXXV* annos vixisse, qui

ἢ* The context no less than the passage to Deuteronomy expressly alluded to
(34, 7) proves that 125 is a mere scribal error for 120. Cp. also Gen. 6, 3.
