clearly implied by Quint. ΙΙ 1, 3. Cp. in general, Hulsebos, de

14 suasoriae quidem etsi etc: Translate: ³ Though the ‘ suaso-
riae,' it is true, are given over to boys, owing to a belief (tamquam)
that they are more elementary and require less skill, the ‘contro-
versiae' are assigned to the more mature,—good heavensl what
stuff they are made of, how contrary to actual happenings they are
concoctedl' Tacitus means to say that the themes of suasoriae
are bad enough, but being confined, from a mistaken notion of
their character, to a lower grade of instruction, they possibly work
less havoc than the equally objectionable controversiae, whose per-
nicious influence naturally strikes a deeper and firmer root in
minds that are more mature, and thus incapacitates them for the
forensic career, upon which they. are so soon to enter.

The editors of the Dial. have with astonishing unanimity deleted ί etsi,'
found in all the MSS„ without even attempting to explain the origin of the
alleged corruption. The objection to ‘etsil seems to be based upon the
assumption that ‘suasoriae ’ and ‘ controversiae’ are contrasted, But this
is not the case, as Vahlen, Prooem. Berol. 1881 p. 81, was the first to point
out. “Tacitus noluit suasorias et controversias pari iuyo coniungere, sed
hoc dicit, in suasoriis quidem, etsi minus damnum sit, quia minoribus
attribuantur, controversias plus nocere, in quibus robustiorum ingenia con-
tundantur et hebescant.’' See also John ad loc. Andresen’s note involves
a petitio principii. He remarks that, “where ‘quidem ’ serves like μέν to
introduce a contrast, the second member is either followed by ‘autem' (δέ),
as in c. 821 1823 2514, or the adversative particle is omitted,” for which
ellipsis he cites—the present passage ! To my mind, this exception clearly
proves that no contrast is here intended. ιιΗ, however,'’ he continues,
“quidem has a concessive force (which it unquestionably has here), it is
either followed by ‘tamen ⁹ as in c. 9 26 or by ‘sed ' as in c. 5 31 8 8.” This
is but partially true, for not only is the ellipsis of adversative particles very
common in Tacitus (see the exx. cited in note c. 6 19) but instances of the
omission of ‘sed' after a concessive ‘quidem’ are particularly frequent!
