caldron-shaped vessel, cortina came to be used, by an easy 113116-
ference, of the vault of heaven (Enn. Ann. v. 9), of the tripod of
Apollo (Verg. Aen. ΠΙ 92 Ov. Met. 15, 635), 311(1 of the auditorium

tor' mentioned 6. 20 8. The judge, the lawyers with their assist-
ants, and the parties in the suit were probably seated ‘within the
railing,' to use a modern phrase.

The meaning here given (it is practically that of Lipsius) is so easily
derived from the analogous uses of the word, and is withal so eminently
suitable to the sense of the passage, that the emendation of Ursinus, though
accepted by Peter, Baehrens, and others, need not be considered seriously‚
the more so, as it is inconceivable how an original ‘corona' could ever
have been corrupted into ‘cortina' For this word must have been
unfamiliar, not to say unknown, to the scribes, at least in the sense which
is here called for. —Baehrens' contention (Comm. crit. p. 75) that ‘vix'

ought to be placed before ‘quisquam’ is based upon a serious misinterpret-
ation of the passage.

21 etsi non instructus at certe imbutus: Instructius like ‘ insti-
tutus⁷ and ‘doctus' is used of systematic training and is opposed
to imbutus, which denotes a superficial and desultory acquisition of
knowledge. Cf. Cic. Phil. X 10, 20 3 maioribus instituti atque
imbuti sumus de orat. ΙΙ 39, 162 liberaliter institutus et aliquo iam
imbutus Orat. 49, 165 11011 instituti sed imbuti sumus. On the
semasiology of ‘imbutus,' see Wilkins, Sandys ll. cc. and John ad
