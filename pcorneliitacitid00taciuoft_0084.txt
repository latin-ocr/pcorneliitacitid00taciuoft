lxxxii PROLEGOMENA.

oratorical achievement which pervades every line of c. 36-40 8
(cp. esp. 37 11 ff), is quite out of place in the mouth of MaternUS,
because he expressly restrains Messalla from indulging in a similar
strain, regarding any panegyric of the eloquence of the republican
period as superfluous. Cp. c. 24 11 exprome nobis non laudationem
antiquorum, satis enim illos fama sua laudat 27 2 neque hoc colligi
desideramuS, disertiores esse antiquos, quod. apud me quidem in
confesso est.

Again in c. 36 23 ff. 34 f. the indispensability of eloquence is
strongly maintained, but Maternus cannot well have shared this
opinion, for otherwise he would hardly have bidden farewell to the
forum. Maternus accepts the reason for the decline of eloquence
as given by the previous speaker, but with this cardinal difference.
The one contends that a sturdy eloquence, however desirable, if
possible only under anarchical conditions, is no compensation for
a peaceful commonwealth with a corresponding oratorical retro-
gression, the other leaves us to infer that he would rejoice in
a superior oratorical development at any cost, though he prizes the-
blessings of peace no less highly than his friend. Maternus, as
behooves the poet, in Aristotle's opinion, takes a philosophical
view3 he deals more or less with general truths. The attitude of
the speaker of c. 36-40 8, on the other hand, is that of the historiam
who searches into the causes that underlie historical phenomena,
and who illustrates his argument by concrete illustrations and
learned detail. Cp. e. g. the reference to Mucianus, the date of
one of Pollio⁷s speeches, the enumeration of Cicero⁷s orationS, the
allusion to an enactment in one of Pompey's laws, the discussion.
concerning the procedure in the law courts, the attire of advocates,
and many minor items. ‘Eadem ratio in nostra quoque civitate’
proves conclusively that the same speaker gave the same reason for
the decline of Greek oratory as for the Roman. But this exposition
is again unsuited to the poet Maternus.

It furnishes the true solution, moreover, of the singular coin-
cidence which Messalla had told his hearers often puzzled. him
(c. 15 13 quod quibusdam solacio est, mihi auget quaestionem
etc). The passages dealing so successfully with this perplexing
problem cannot therefore have been spoken by Messalla. The
same inference must be drawn from a more external observation.
Messalla's share in the debate takes up about three tenths of the
