5 adversus ‘as compared with.⁷ Cf. Ann. XII 15 nec fuit in
arduo societas potentiam Romanam adversus rebellem Mithridatem
ostentantibus XV 19 labores educandi adversus fraudem . . .
adoptionis enumerant. Ann. III 29 and XV 63, cited respectively
by Peter and Wolff, are quite different. This usage seems not
to occur elsewhere, except in two passages in Livy: VII 32 quid

autem esse duo prospera . . . bella Samnitium adversus tot decora
populi R. and XXIV 8 adversus veterem . . . imperatorem com-
parabitur.

6 fecundissima: In this figurative sense, the word is post-
Augustan. In Tacitus again: H. I 51 Π 92 IV 50 Ann. VI 27
XIV 13 but not used absolutely as here.

7 quem ad modum in comparative clauses is extremely rare in
Tacitus. Cf. Ann. ΠΙ 55 ut quem ad modum temporum vices ita
morum vertantur VI 24 ut q. . . . complevisset, ita . . . exsolveret.
See note c. 36 32.-—iuvenes iam et forum ingressuri: The et is
epexegetic, on which see note c. 7 16.

The words of Messalla at the beginning of the following chapter, as well
as the clear antithesis between ‘artibus instrui ' and ⁴ exercitationibus’
strongly favor ‘ ingressi ’ as the original reading. Writing ‘ingressuri’ we
should also expect ‘et iam forum,' as suggested by Ernesti, 01· ‘et forum
iam.’—Cornelissen’s easy emendation ‘conformare’ commends itself on
two grounds: it is more closely allied in meaning to ‘alere’ and avoids
the ὕστερον πρότερον. The word is used in the same figurative sense in Tac.
Ann. IV 8 orbatos sibi et posteris conformaret. Cf. also Hor. A. P. 307
alat formetque poetam, but Cic. de orat. II 28, 123 has aluero confirmaro.

11 abnues = negabis. The acc. with inf. after ³ abnuere ² in this
sense is still rare in Cicero e. g. de leg. Ι 14, 40 but more common
in Livy. In Tac. e. g. H. III 54 abnuenti vera esse quae adferret
Ann. XV 22 abnuentibus consulibus ea de re relatum. Cp. Woelfflin,
Archiv IV 581.

12 significare vultu videntur: We must supply ‘se non abnuere'
not ‘ eloquentiam contineri‚' as is clearly indicated by ² vultu!

13 011111 Aper· - - adnuissent: The phrase was perhaps suggested
by Cic. Fragm. Hortens. 4 Or. quod cum uterque nostrum adnu-
issent.-—quoque- · - idem: The same pleonastic collocation‚ if such
it be, is found e. g. Quint. XII 3, 4 idem Graecos quoque factitasse.
Cp. Binde, De T. dial. quaest. orit. Berl. Diss. 1884 pp. 28-41.
Maternus had previously inferred the acquiescence of Aper and
Secundus only by their negative attitude, now they both gave

positive assent.
