PROLEGOMENA. xxvii

‘conducive to clearness, if the following discussion deals exclusively
with this scholar’s presentment of the case.³⁰

After dismissing, in a few words, the evidence of the MSS. as
worthless and dealing with the alleged difficulties regarding the
dramatic date in the traditional way, Andresen proceeds as follows:
The Dialogus cannot have been written during the reign 01 Domitian,
because it contains criticisms on men and measures which could not
have been given publicity under that emperor. Nor canit have been
composed before Domitian, chiefly for two 16350115. (1) The words
in the introductory chapter ‘ quos eandem hanc quaestionem pertra—
ctantes iuvenis admodum audivi ' are unintelligible, unless we supply
in thought “ and as a mature man Ι now reproduce in writing, what

= I then heard,” but as Tacitus was 27 years old in 81 Α. 11., 116 could

not have designated himself as ‘iuvenis admodum' with reference
to the time in which, at the age of 21, he had listened to the debate
in question (75 A. 11.),31 101· we should in that case have expected
some expression like ‘paucos abhinc annos.⁷ It is equally incred-
ible, that so deep a problem as the causes of the decline 01
eloquence would readily have suggested itself to a youth of 27,

ζ , ἢ even granting that he possessed the requisite intellectual maturity

 

to grapple with it. Nor is it at all probable that Fabius Iustus,
who cannot have been much more than twenty in the reign 01
Titus, had occupied himself with this difficult question at this
time. (2) It is incredibie, that the passages concerning Eprius
Marcellus and Vibius Crispus (c. 8 and 13) were written at a time,
when these powerful informers were still alive and in the enjoy-
ment of imperial favor. Marcellus, it is graciously admitted, was
dead when Titus ascended the throne, but Crispus lived to a green
old age, highly esteemed by Domitian, until 93 A. 11. Hence the
Dialogus must have been written, at the very earliest, shortly after
this date. But this approaches a period in which the style of
Tacitus had already been fully developed, at least in its essential
features,²³2 and we are, therefore, put to the alternative 01 denying
