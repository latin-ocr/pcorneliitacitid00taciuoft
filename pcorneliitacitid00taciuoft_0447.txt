Some Mss, both here and 6. 30 20, where the same sciences are enume-
rated, exhibit the Greek endings (grammatice, musice, geometrice). But
Tacitus, very unlike Quintilian in this respect (see Bonnell Lex. Proleg.
XX-XXVI), habitually ‚avoids Greek forms and inflections, no less than
Greek words (on which see note 6. 5 32), the only exceptions being perhaps
the name Ooez'onas (G. 46) and the quasi-proper name meqistcmas (Ann.
XV 27), a word of Persian origin, signifying magnates. On ⁶ rhetoras,' 566

see note.

i. e. ³ For occasions may arise in which a superficial acquaintance

with the law is all that⁷s desii-ed, nay I may say, this will generally,
if not always be the case; in .many instances, however, also a
thorough knowledge of the above mentioned subjects will be neces-
sary.'

‘incidunt’ implies the idea of casual occurrence and hence ‘plurimae
quidem etc.' is added to prevent any misunderstanding of the speaker's
real meaning. ⁴ quibus iuris etc.,’ the reading of all the MSS„ is clearly
distinguished from ‘in quibus’ below, for the law pertains to the entire
case, 6 knowledge of music, geometry, etc. only to particular parts. Cp.
John ad loc. and note 6. 21 32. Baehrens (C'omm. Crz’t. p. 88) understands
‘haec scientia' to refer to the knowledge of the law, and regards ‘notitia . . .
desideratur’ and ‘ scientia requiritur' as a climaX, an interpretation which
he is unable to uphold without a number of arbitrary changes. Andresen‚

overawed by the alleged difficulties of the passage, deletes the entire clause,
from ⁶ inciduntssrequiriturst It may be admitted that these words are not

essential to the context, but how a scribe ever came to insert, on mere
caprice, three lines, it were difficult to divine.

32. 1 sufficere ut is very rare. Cf. Plin. Ep. IX 21,3 interim
sufficiet ut exorari te sinas, with ‘ne‚' ibid. 33, 11 and Tac. Ann.
