3 Servio Galbae: Servius Sulpicius Galba was born about 189 Β. 0.
and was an older contemporary of Laelius and the younger Africa-
nus. Elected Praetor in 151, he received Spain for his province.
His campaign is made memorable by his massacre of the Lusita-
1118118, 0110 of the most scandalous acts of treachery and cold-blooded
cruelty recorded in history. Cp. Mommsen, Refm. Gcsch. ΙΙΙ 8.
Though accused in consequence and attacked by the aged 08130, 110
secured his acquittal through bribery and by an appeal to the
sympathy of the people by bringing his children into court. He was
elected consul in 144, and survived the year 138. Of his eloquence
Cicero always speaks 111 terms of highest praise, although he was
not blind to his many stylistic shortcomings. Cf. de orat. I 10, 40

him, but he forestalled impending conviction by committing suicide.
