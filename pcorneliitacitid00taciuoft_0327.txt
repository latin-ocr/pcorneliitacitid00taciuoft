wrote a voluminous and eulogistic biography of his patron, the
fourth book, as we learn from Asconius p. 49 Or„ treating of the
Clodian episode. Cp. Teuffel, Ram. Lit.⁵ ἓ 191. Plutarch, though
he cites Tiro but twice (Cic. c. 41. 49) made very extensive use of
this work—scripsit: ‘has recorded.5 The perfect expresses the
authoritative character of this information. The exclusive use of

the present tense, in citations from extant writers is a modern
idiom. Cf. Tac. Ann. XIV 2 tradit Cluvius . . . sed quae Cluvius

So also in Greek e. g. Plat. Men. 7 6 D ἔφη Πίνδαρος Lach. 291 b

was assassinated in the year 43 B. c.,. but the day and the month
(Dec. 7) are known only from this passage. That it was the month
of December, for this is omitted in our MSS. and was inserted
into the text by Lipsius, is proved by the date of the formation
of the second triumvirate which proscribed the orator, Nov. 27, 43.

this day, Tac. Ann. I 9 Suet. Octav. 100 and Cass. Dio LVI 30 date
the reign of Augustus. Cp. Furneaux, Ann. Vol. I 64 ff. and the
authorities there cited. Q. Pedius, a nephew of C. Julius Caesar,
was praetor 483 was sent in 45 as legatus against the Pompeian
forces in Spain, receiving the honors of a triumph in the same year.
On his election to the consulship, he passed the so-called lex Pedia,
by which the assassins of Caesar were punished with ‘aquae et
ignis interdictio! He was in charge of Rome when the news of
the formation of the second triumvirate and the proscriptions
reached him. He with great difficulty prevented an open insur-
rection‚ but overcome with fatigue expired suddenly on the fol-
lowing night.
