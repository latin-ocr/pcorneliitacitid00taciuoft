in homine aliena laudare ? quid eo dementius, qui ea miratur quae
ad alium transferri protinus possunt. 8 Lauda in ipso quod nec
eripi potest nec dari. Ep. 98, 13- Honores reppulit, pater Sextius
. . . latum clavum, divo Iulio dante, non recepit. Intellegebat enim,
quod dari posset, et eripi posse.

25 Minimum inter tot ac tanta locum: Minimum :infimum is
apparently ἅπ. εῖρ., the nearest approach to it being Plin. N. H.
XIV 1. Locum magnum obtinet in medicaminibus—tot ac tanta
= tot ac tantas res. Tot as a neuter substantive is not found else-
where, but analogous instances are common in Silver Latin, and par-
ticularly characteristic of Tacitus. E. g. c. 39 16 tot pariter ac tam
nobiles (with note). Sen. Ep. 108, 38 tot ac talium (sc. virorum).
Cic. Cael. 28, 66 Ovid, Am. ΙΙ 12,1Ο. So also c. 19 20 pervulgatis
iam omnibus (sc. rebus), c. 21 1 quibusdam, where see notes.
Ann. ΙΙΙ 15 nullo (= nulla re), where see Nipp. Sen. Ep. 33, 2
illo (= illa re). Cp. also Dr. Η. S. Ι 54 ff.

There is, therefore, no real necessity for writing with Vahlen haec tot,
on the analogy of Cic. pro Rosc. 32, 89 haec tot et tanta . . . quamdiu
diceres.

Imagines ac tituli et statuae:= As Aper is speaking of novi
homines sine commendatione natalium, imayines cannot refer to the
waxen images of ancestors, but rather to the so-called ‘clipeatae’ or
‘ argenteae imagines' which represented the Emperor or his amici or
some distinguished man. Tituli were the inscriptions on these,
hence joined by ac, i. e. imag. cum titulis et statuae. Plin„ Pan.
103 is less careful to bring out this dependent relation, when he
says ‘titulis et imag. et stat.' On the subject itself, cp. Mommsen,
Reim. Staastr. Ι 426 ff. Marquardt, Privatl. Ι 235 ff. Smith, Dice.
Ant. 1³ 992, where other literature is cited. John well observes
that Maternus' answer (c. 1114) seems to imply that this method
of decorating one’s house was less a valued privilege than a kind of
irksome duty, by which the incumbent of an office gave outward
expression of his loyalty.

26 neque=ne—quidem. In Tac. again H. IV 80 Ann. ΙΙ 82
ΙΙΙ 29. 56 XV 18. See Madvig, de fin. p. 803 ff. and note c. 21 37.

27 divitiae et opes: Divitiae occurs in T. only here and in Ann.
XVI 3 divitiarum expectatio, where opes immediately precedes.
The whimsical aversion to this word is a unique peculiarity of Taci-
tus. The same collocation in Flor. ΙΙΙ 12, 7 Iustin. Ι 7. The
