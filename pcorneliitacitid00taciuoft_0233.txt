explained. Nipperdey Rh. Mu& XIX 271-277, prefers to 'change the first ‘sive’
into ‘vel‚' but his contention that ‘in senatu ' and ‘apud principem' belong
closely together is quite groundless. I can recognise only two members,
vel and sive having accidentally changed places. ‘Sive in iudicio vel in
senatu ⁹ form the one (often combined by Cicero), ‘sive apud principem,’ the
new judicial tribunal unknown to the Roman republic, the other. Qf. Tac.
Ann. XIV 7 sive servitia armaret vel militem accenderet sive ad senatum et
populum pervaderet. c. 28 2 aut tibi ipsi aut huic Secundo vel huic Apro,
with note. This interpretation derives weighty support from the change of
the preposition (in—in-apud)‚ for had T. intended a mere enumeration‚ he
would probably have written sive (vel) apud iudicem (or centumviros) sive
(vel) apud patres sive (vel) apud principem. See c. 7 5 f.

30 Eprius Marcellus: His full name and the principal offices
, which he held are given in an inscription from Capua, his probable
birthplace. O. I. L. X 3853: T. Clodio, M. f. Pal(atina sc.
tribu), Eprio Marcello cos. ΙΙ (61 and 74 A. D.), auguri, curioni
maximo, sodali Augustali pr(aetori) per(egrino) procos. Asiae III
(7 0-73 A. D.) provincia Cypros. A notorious informer (under
Nero) and a powerful.friend of Vespasian (cf. c. 8> he, for reasons
unknown to us, conspired against the emperor and was driven to
suicide in 7 9 A. D. (cf. Cass. Dio 66, 16). Of the three encounters
with Helvidius Priscus (cf. H) IV 6, 5. 6 10-9, 43.) the third
(c. ’70 A. D.) is undoubtedly the one here alluded to, not the second,
as is shown by the terms nuper . . infestibus patribus . . minax . .
elusit, none of which is applicable to the debate between Hel-
vidius and Marcellus so vividly sketched by Tacitus H. IV 6 10-9,
but they unmistakably refer to the last unsuccessful attempt of
Helvidius to crush his old enemy. Cf. Tac. H. IV 43 Tanto cum
adsensu senatus auditus est Montanus ut spem caperet Helvidius
posse etiam Marcellum prosterni . . . crimine simul exemploque
Eprium urguebat, ardentibus patrum animis (zinfestis patribus)
quod ubi sensit Marcellus: ‘imus' inquit, ‘Prisce, et relinquimus
tibi senatum tuum: regna praesente Caesare.⁷ sequebatur Vibius
Priscus, ambo infensi, vultu diverso, Marcellus minacibus oculis,
Crispus renidens . . . consumptus per discordiam dies. The char-
acter given to Marcellus, the tribute paid to his eloquence, both
here and more fully c. 8 and 13 11 ff., are in perfect accord with
the references to him found in the historical writings of Tacitus,
even down to the epithet ‘minax' (H. 1. c. Ann. XVI 29). On the
importance of this coincidence in determining the author of the
Dialogus, ,zee Prolegomena p. xliii f.
