3 Crassi maturitatem: maturitas signifies the full, all-round
development of mental powers and hence is used as a synonym of
³ perfectus.' See Cic. Brut. 92, 318 (cited c. 22 10) and note c. 3 12.
The same epithet is applied to Crassus by Macrob. VI, 16 sunt
stili dicendi duo . . . unus est maturus ’et graviS, qualis Crasso adsi-
gnatur. May not this be a reminiscence of the present passage ?
Crassus is at least not elsewhere in extant writers so desig-
nated. —- calamistros Maecenatis: calamistri, literally ’011111113-
irons or crisping-pins.’ . The expression, in the figurative sense of
² rhetorical flourishes' is borrowed from Cicero who uses it twice :
Brut. 7 5, 262 qui volent illa (sc. Caesaris commentarios) calamistris
inurere Orat. 23, 7 8 ne calamistri quidem adhibebuntur (sc. ora-
tioni), where see Sandys' note. On the effeminate and florid style
of MaecenaS, cf. Suet. OctaV. 86 exagitabatque in primis Maece-
natem suum, cuius μυροβρεχεῖς, ut ait, cincinnos usquequaque perse-
quitur et imitando per iocum irridet (See Macrob. II 4, 12) and
esp. Sen. Ep. 114, 4 magni vir ingenii fuerat si . . . non etiam in
oratione difflueret, videbis itaque eloquentiam ebrii hominis, invo-
lutam et errantem et licentiae plenam 6 non statim cum haec
(the characteristic specimen of his style quoted in ξ 5) legeris, hoc
tibi occurret hunc esse qui solutis tunicis in urbe semper incesserit
sqq. ⁸? In general, cp. Teuffel, R.. L. ἓ 220, 6-9 Mayor, Iuv. I 66.
With the phrase, cp. also Goethe, Faust: Eure Reden . . In denen
ihr der Menschheit Schnitzel kriiuselt.

4 tinnitus Gallionis. L Iunius Gallio, the friend of Ovid and of
Seneca Rhetor, and the judge who presided at the trial of St.
Paul was the author of a rhetorical treatise (Quint. ΠΙ 1, 21) and

declamationesss from which Seneca has preserved numerous speci-
mens Cp. Teuffel, R. L. ἓ 268, 7. These cannot, of course, either
confirm or disprove Messalla⁷s unfavorable criticism, as is clear
from a remark in Sen. Contr. III praef. 18 ext. Gallio’s enduring
reputation seems to be attested, however, by Apoll. Sid. Ep. V 10
who predicates ‘ gravitas ' of him and by a passage in Hieronymus
cited c. 26 32. ——tinnitus ³ jingling style.' In this figurative sense,
the word is ἅπ. εῖρ., but its analogue ‘tinnulus' occurs once in
Hieron. Ep. 143, 2 tinnula verba. So κώδωνες is similarly used by
the author Of Περὶ ὕψους 23, 4 ἐπεί τοι τὸ πανταχοῦ κώδωνας ἔξῆφθαι,
λίαν σοφιστικόν.-Οὶ)εο1νο the incongruity of the antithesis, the
comparison being in reality made between the yeneral oratorical
