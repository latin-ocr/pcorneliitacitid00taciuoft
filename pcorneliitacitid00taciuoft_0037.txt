PROLEGOMENA. XXXV

It may be well, at this point, to cast a brief retrospective glauce
over the ground so far traversed. We have seen that the testimony
01 the MSS„ though they are derived from a single copy of the 13111
century, which may, however, be traced back to an archetypon 01

’ζ the 9th century, cannot be justly impeached3 we have seen that the
ἶ dramatic date of the dialogue, though hitherto open to doubt, owing

to a persistent misinterpretation of a passage in c. 17, can be deter—

mined with satisfactory accuracy (74s75 A. 0.). 1t has also been
, ’ shown that our treatise cannot possibly have been composed and

published later than the reign of Titus (79-81), every other date
involving us in insuperable difficulties3 that the phrase ³ iuvenis
admodum’ is free from objections3 that Tacitus, at the age of 27,

in common with the subject matter of the 20th letter under discussion, and yet
Wutk triumphantly concludes: ex his atque talibus locis quibus probatur vel
eisdem vel similibus vel diversis& quoque interdum de eloquentia opinionibus
Tacitum et Plinium esse ductos, Plinium illam epistolam ad Tacitum dare non

’Ῠ potuisse efficitur si dialogum legisset, antequam ad amicum scriberet. Nosset

enim omnia quae interroyaturus esset in dial090 responsum. Ex quo conficitur,
ut litterae a Plinio tum missae sint cum opusculum illud Tacitus nondum com-
posuerat (i. e. after 99 A. 0.). Never‚ perhaps, has an equally far-reaching
inference been based upon more gratuitous and utterly fallacious assumptions,
In the first place, it is not true ,11131 the Dialogus gives an answer to Pliny's
question3 011 the very contrary, it must have left him completely in the dark,
as it does every reader of to-day, as to Tacitus’ own opinion, for the author
impartially allows Aper on the one hand, and Messalla (c. 31) and Secundus
(c. 38) on the other, to give expression to diametrically opposite views‚ so that
the Dialogue, so far from rendering the 20111 letter superfluous, might even have
induced Pliny to compose it! But suppose for a moment the Dialogus did
contain α satisfactory answer to Pliny's inquiry‚ it would still not follow that
the letter antedated the treatise‚ Wutk accepts the Tacitean authorship, and
as no amount of exegetical sleight-of-hand (e. g. p. XI f.) can dispose of the

, obstacles in the way 01 3 later date than the reign of Titus, an interval of nearly

twenty years will have elapsed between the publication of the Dialogue and the
composition of the letter, taking Wutk's own date. This being so, is it un-
reasonable, I ask, to imagine that Pliny at the age of 37 (born 62 Α. D.) might
possibly have forgotten all about the passages in the Dialogus which he had
read at the age 01 18-19, for according to Wutk‚ Pliny's high admiration for
Tacitus precludes his ignorance of any work his intimate friend had written ἰ’
And if we add that the references in question are but incidental to the main
design of the treatise‚ it ought to be clear to everybody not blinded by pre-

., conceived opinions that Pliny's letter in no sense implies the non-existence of

 

the Dialogus. On Wutk's own theory, finally, the publication of the DIalogus
would be well-nigh coincident with that 01 the Historiesi Pliny alludes to the
latter3 how could he ignore the former ἵ) 1
