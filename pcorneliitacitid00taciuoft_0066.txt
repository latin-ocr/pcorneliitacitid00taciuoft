11.-THE DRAMATIC STRUOTURE ΟΕ THE DIALOGUS, Am>
THE INTERLOGUTORS.

The scenery of the Dialogue is laid in the house of the poet
Curiatius Maternus. One aft'ernoon128 of the year 7 4s7 5 A. D., pre-
sumably in the winter, as the conversation takes place 111-(10018,
Μ310118 Aper and Julius Secundus, two intimate friendS, accom-
panied by a devoted disciple, the youthful Tacitus, 0311 upon their
mutual friend and to their surprise find him reading the very
tragedy which he had the day previous recited and which had,
as we are told, given offence to the ‘powers that be,' because of
some pronounced liberal sentiments put into the mouth of Cato
Uticensis, the hero of the play. Secundus deprecates the out-
spokenness which the poet has injudiciously thought fit to display,
and Aper endeavors to impress upon him the necessity as well as
the expediency of entirely abandoning so -precarious and useless a
pursuit, particularly as it must seriously interfere with his forensic
duties. Maternus in reply, to the evident astonishment of 1118
visitors, expresses his unalterable determination to withdraw en-
tirely from the forum and the law-courts, and to devote himself
henceforth exclusively to the cultivation of the Muses.

This announcement naturally leads to 3 discussion between
Maternus and Aper, touching the intrinsic value and respective
superiority of oratory over poetry, Secundus having politely but
firmly declined to act as umpire, because of ineradicable prejudices
for one side of the question. The ensuing debate, conducted in set
speeches, which admirably portray the character and convictions of
the two contestants, is made to end 111 3 draw, for reasons to be
pointed out below, a turn in the conversation being brought about
by a not uncommon dramatic device, borrowed in this instance
directly from Cicero, namely, the introduction of a new speaker, in
the person of Vipstanus Messalla.

The new-comer observing from the countenances of those present,
that the discussion, interrupted by his entrance, had been unusually
warin and animated, it naturally fell to the lot of Secundus, as the
only passive listener‚¹29 to acquaint Messalla with the subject of

12⁸ The time of day may be inferred from c. 42 ext. nisi iam dies esset

exactus, for the entire dialogue is of comparatively very short duration.
129 The youthful author being a persona muta throughout, keeps himself
studiously in the background and is, dramatically considered, non-existent.
