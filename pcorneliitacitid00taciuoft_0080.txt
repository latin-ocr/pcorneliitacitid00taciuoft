existence. But the non-indication of a lacuna is by no means a
clear proof of its non-existence. For while it may be admitted that
the writer of the archetypon of our MSS. may have been careful
enough to leave a vacant space, in the expectation that the missing
portions might some day be found, the scribes of a later age, no
longer cherishing such hope, would either content themselves with
a few dots or a vacant space, which in turn might be easily over-
looked by Subsequent copyists, or else they would at once write on
continuously, thus covering up all signs of an original gap. That

this happened repeatedly in actual practice is a fact indisputably .

lacunae confined to the omissions of mere words and phrases.¹⁶⁷ To
show the inherent weakness of the objection in question, it is only
necessary to draw attention to an instance very near at hand, which
