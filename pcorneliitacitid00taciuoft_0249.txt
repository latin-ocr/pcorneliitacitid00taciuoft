XXXIV 137 ff., Archiv VI 89—91. -The fondness for such super-
fluous compounds is characteristic of the decline, the force of the
preposition being no longer or but vaguely felt. In Latin it may¹
be said to assume noticeable proportions with Asinius Pollio and
in Greek during the Alexandrian period. The Romans themselves
seem, with the solitary exception of Seneca (see Ep. 58, 3 f.), to
have been unconscious of this peculiarity of post-Augustan Latin.

19 adgnoscere‘=recognise.⁷ Velut is added, because these stran-
gers had not previously seen the orators themselves, but could only
know them from the descriptions of others.

8. 1 Marcellum hunc Eprium: Cf. c. 5 30.--Crispum Vibium:
Q. (acc. to C. I. A. III 1, 619) Vibius Crispus, like Marcellus, with
whom he is again associated by Tacitus in H. IV 42. 43, a notorious
