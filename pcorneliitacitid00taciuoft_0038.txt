xxxvi PROLEGOMENA.

as we must infer from the high official position and. the oratorical
reputation to which he had already attained, was unquestionably of
sufficient intellectual maturity to grapple with a problem, in which
by reason of his rhetorical training he would naturally have felt
an interest.

Now, if we can finally trace'*an adequately striking correspond-
ence between the political, social and ethical convictions, the

criticisms on men and measures, the literary judgments'found in ¹

the historical works of Tacitus and the Dialogue; if even the style ’
should reveal remarkable and numerous coincidences3 if, in a word,
to use Lipsius' phrase, ‘liniamenta quaedam apparent eiusdem viri
et vultus,' we shall be forced to conclude that the cumulative
weight of these parallelisms of thought and diction will form a
chain of evidence in favor of Tacitean authorship of irrefragable
strength.

In the following some of the more salient coincidences of the
many pointed out or discussed in the NoteS, are more conveniently
grouped together and classified.⁴2

(a) Politioal Views.

Sixteen years had elapsed between the Dialogus (80s81) and the
Agricola (97), followed closely by the Germania (98). The Histories
were published between 105 and 109 and the Annals about 115.
During this eventful period, the great historian had seen seven
emperors come and go; he had lived, in enforced literary silence,⁴3

43 Ag. 3 tot annis, quibus iuvenes ad senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae
aetatis terminos per silentiu-m venimus. Non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi
voce memoriam prioris servitutis ac testimonium praesentium bonorum com-
posuisse. This famous passage does not necessarily exclude a rhetorical treatise
like the Dialogus any more than some of Tacitus' speeches which were certainly
published in the reign of Domitian, as we must infer from Pliny’s letters. The
composition of the Dialogue during that time is rendered impossible on internal
grounds, and the above statement of Tacitus, as is clear from the context, refers
only to works of a historical description. Nothing is gained by attempting to
prove too much, a fault into which many advocates of the Tacitean authorship, “
notably Weinkauff, have repeatedly fallen. ’
