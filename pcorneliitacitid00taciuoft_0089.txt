111.--T11E LITERARY soURcEs OF THE DIALOGUS.'

v The Dialogus de oratoribus purports to be, as we have seen, the The Dialoyue
v faithful reproduction from memory of a debate which the young fidamus·
ᾖ Tacitus had been privileged to listen to, and which, about seven

years later, after the death of the noted interlocutors, still seemed
to him of sufficient interest and positive value to merit the atten-
tion of posterity.

The great majority of editors and critics, with the solitary
exception of Kleiber and Rausch,¹¹'⁷ tacitly assume that the author's
explanation of the origin of the treatise was given in good faith, a
few only venturing far enough to concede at least the bare pos-

. sibility that the debate in question may be in reality essentially
unhistorical. The above-mentioned scholars dealt with this subject
only incidentally, and neglected many clear indications of the
correctness of their view. The following remarks will therefore
not be out of place.

The Dialogus, we contend, is a treatise cast into the dramatic
form of a debate by its author for the same reasons that prompted
Plato or Cicero to choose this particular species of literary com-
position. For it, and it alone, enabled them thoroughly to discuss
a subject from all points of view, without ex cathedra utterances or
dogmatic exposition. The grounds which compel me to look upon
the Dialogue in this light are briefly as follows z

(1) There is no instance of a similar work in any literature
which can be regarded as strictly historical. In all dialogical com-
position the author invariably exercises the right of the creative
artist to invent his characters and to place them in such situations,
as may be best conducive to the accomplishment of his object, but,
being an artist, he also endeavors to impart an air of verisimilitude
to his creation by giving a kind of pictorial reality to the scenery
