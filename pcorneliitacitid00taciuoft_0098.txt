Mucianus.

xcvi rRoLEGOMENA.

The works of Seneca, moreover, with the solitary exception of a
few epistles, like the lOOth and the 114th, furnish little or no
material which the author of a treatise on eloquence might have
incorporated with advantage. Tacitus, under the influence of
Quintilian⁷s teaching, took Cicero for his model, and the Dialogus
in consequence betrays at every turn the paramount influence which
the profound study of all the orator's writings exerted upon the
youthful author. This fact alone renders it intrinsically improb-
able that he should at the same time have allowed himself to be
captivated by the scintillating brilliancy of Seneca⁷s style, a view
amply borne out by the absence of all qcnuinc reminiscenceS. We
therefore conclude that, while an acquaintance with the writings of
Seneca on the part of Tacitus cannot be denied, we are not justified,
on the face of the evidence accessible to us, in including his works
among the sources of the Dialogus.

Ancient writers rarely cite their authorities, and Tacitus is no
exception to this rule. Sometimes, however, the source of some
particular piece of information is given, and if the original work
is fortunately still extant, as for example in the case of Cicero,
we are apt to discover to our surprise that the extent of the
author's indebtedness is far greater than one could have sup-
posed. Now this fact, for which we possess numerous analogieS,
necessarily creates a very strong suspicion or presumption that a ’
closer relationship, than might appear at first sight, exists, where an
equally casual acknowledgment is made to some work, preserved to
us only in fragments, as the Hortensius, 01· entirely lost. To this
latter class belong the compilations of Mucianus, entitled ‘Acta’
and ³ Epistolae,' which are known to us only from a solitary refer-
ence in the Dialogus The former of these, as has been remarked
