xxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

him; the age, owing in a large measure perhaps to his own teach·
ing, seemed again favorable to the healthy growth and development
of a truer eloquence. Without this conviction, the Institutio could
never have been penned. Again, if the problem of the decline of
eloquence had still been a living issue at the close of the lst cen-
tury, where should we have come upon clearer indications of its
existence than in the epigrams of Martial or in the letters of Pliny,
which so faithfully mirror the intellectual movements of the time ἱ)
Of oratorical decadence, of corruption—not a word. The historical
works of Tacitus himself point in the same direction. In fact, the
amount of attention paid by these writers to oratorical achieve-
ments, the high meed of praise bestowed upon orators, the very
number mentioned, prove that the decline os eloquence no longer
disturbed their reflections.

Now the Dialogus is, in my judgment, a special contribution,
perhaps the ablest and profoundest, to this controversy, and hence
it was necessarily written at a time when the question was still
agitating some of the best minds of literary Rome. But this was
no longer the case at the close of Domitian's reign, or in that of
'Nerva or of Trajan. The Dialogus could, therefore, no more have
been composed at this late date, whether by Tacitus or any other
contemporary, than Pei-rault⁷s Paralleles des anciens et des mo-
dernes or Swift⁷s Battle of the Books 001116 have been penned in
the days of Louis XVI. or George I. These questions had all been
finally disposed of and now figured only in history, typifying
certain intellectual movements of an earlier period.⁴¹

41 It is with some reluctance that I take notice of Wutk's lamentable failure
to prove that the Dialogus of Tacitus cannot antedate the 20111 epistle of the lst
book of Pliny's correspondence, which he assigns on quite unJ'ustifiable grounds
to the year 99 A.D., but as SchanZ, Rom. Lit. p. 363, has been led astray by
Wutk's illogical and often disingenuous argumentation, this contribution to the
‘ Controversy' must needs be dignified by serious refutation. The letter in
question—WVutk, instead of citing the original, characteristically paraphrases
its contents—discusses the relative superiority of copiousness and brevity in
oratorical composition, and Pliny, who declares in favor of the former, asks his
friend Tacitus to give his views on the subject. Now Wutk asserts that Pliny
could not have made this request, if he had read the Dialogus, inasmuch as
Tacitus had there already given a satisfactory answer (0. 19 9 ff.). A copious
array of alleged parallelisms between Pliny and our treatise is then addueed‚ all
of which had been previously utilised by Nast and Hess to prove the Plinian
authorship of the Dialogus ! 1 Νο116 of these passages, moreover, have anything
