5 secedit animus: This sentence ought logically to have been
incorporated in the preceding : Non in strepitu . . . reorum sed in
10018 puris . . . sedibusque sacris componuntur. But the importance
which the speaker attaches to sylvan retirement as best suited to
poetic contemplation, caused him to add this idea, by way of promi-
nence, as a principal clause. Quintilian in a long passage (X 3,
22—33) takes direct issue with this view: Non tamen protinus
audiendi qui credunt aptissima in hoc nemora silvasque quod illa
caeli libertas locorumque amoenitas sublimem animum et beatiorem
spiritum parent, mihi certe iucundus hic magis quam studiorum
hortator videtur esse secessus . . . Namque illa, quae ipsa delectant,
11000880 est avocent ab intentione operis destinati . . . quare silvae-
rum amoenitas . . . 013 ipsa late circumspiciendi libertas ad 80 1310-
hunt ut mihi remittere potius voluptas ista videatur cogitationem
quam intendere. These statements are sufficiently general to be
applicable to pursuits other than those of oratory, ⁴although Quin-
tilian primarily intended them for the latter.

6 haec· · - haec· · · hoc· · · sic: This particular anaphora is logi-
cally justified only, if ‘primordia' and ‘ penetralia’ are not taken 111
‘a too strictly local sense. The anacoluthon, spoken of above,
caused ³ haec ² to be joined to ‘sedes ⁷ as its real antecedent, where—
as, in reality, it refers to the act of poetic composition implied.
in the preceding clause, i. 0. poetry composed amid the woodland
seclusion of hallowed places is the earliest and holiest form which
eloquence assumed) For a similar anaphora cf. G. 18 1100-- 1100
— 1100 - 810 -810, Cp. John ad loc. and especially Wiesler, Progr.
Leoben (1886) pp. 6-8.

7 commoda: ‘accommodating herself to the primitive minds of
the men of that early period' i. e. it assumed the form which best
suited their understanding. For this meaning of ε0011111100.0,’ 800
