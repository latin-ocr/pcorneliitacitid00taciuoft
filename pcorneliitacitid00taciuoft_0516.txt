26 nec bene famam eloquentiae Cicero tali exitu pensavit: Cicero
dearly bought his oratorical reputation by the vwretched death he
suffered in consequence. Cf. Sen. de remed. fort. 12, 4 Η. si muti
fuissent, Cicero et Demosthenes et diutius vixissent et lenius obi-
issent Ps. Quint. Decl. 268 quid ego dicam quantum· civitati profu-
erit eloquentia ? sibi nocuit. Summos utriusque partis oratores
videamus. Nonne Demosthenem . . . 3 nonne Ciceronem in illis . . .
rostris poenae suae expositum Iuv. X 118 ff. eloquio sed uterque
(80. Dem. et Cic.) perit orator . . . nec umquam Ι sanguine causidici
maduerunt rostra pusilli. Secundus had admitted in c. 37 19 ff. that
the superior eloquence of the ancients was but a poor compensation
for the anarchical conditions which alone had rendered its growth
possible. This is true, rejoins Maternus, but it should also be
added, that not even these orators themselves were allowed to enJ'oy
q the fruits of their reputation‚ for they all met with a violent end.
See Andresen ad loc.

27 pensare = compensare is post-Aug. Cf. e. g. Vell. II 88 prae-
maturam mortem immortali nominis sui pensavit memoria and
often. In Tac. in this sense only here. On the simple verb for
the compound, cf. note c. 1 18. '

Maternus had occupied himself (0. 40) with an examination of the argu-
ments of Secundus, which he had drawn from the political conditions of
the Republic (0. 36-37 ext). Beginning with 0. 38, Secundus discussed the
constitution of the law-courts. Accordingly Maternus, following the same
order of topics‚ proceeds with a consideration oi the statements in this
second part of Secundus' speech. This symmetrically elaborated antithesis
and the constant polemical allusions to subJ‘ects touched upon in c. 38 (800
1110 following notes) are, in my judgment‚ absolutely inexplicable on the
theory that Maternus was the speaker throughout. Cp. Proleg. p. lxxx ff.

41. 1 quod superest antiqui oratoribus fori etc. This is in
answer to the words of Secundus c. 36 off. horum quoque tempo·
rum oratores ea consecuti sunt, quae composita et quieta et beata
re publica tribui fas est, where see note, alluding at the same time
to c. 38 10 omnia in foro . . . quod maius arqumentum est etc.
What little of forensic pleading‚ Maternus replies, still remains to
modern orators, for causae centumvitales, as we have just been
told, now hold the first place (c. 38 11) and are tried in ³ auditoria '
